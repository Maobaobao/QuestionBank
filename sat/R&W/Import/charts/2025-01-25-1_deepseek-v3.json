      "text": "This chart illustrates the effect on revenue when the average-performing partner leans harder into a particular profile. Moving from a weak to a strong demonstration of Activator skills results in a revenue-generation increase of up to 32%. The opposite is true for the other approaches, all of which are negatively correlated with performance. For example, a shift from weak to strong in the Expert profile results in a drop in revenue generation of up to 15%."
