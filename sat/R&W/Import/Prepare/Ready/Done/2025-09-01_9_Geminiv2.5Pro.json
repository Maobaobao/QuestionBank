      "passage_number": 1,
      "text": "Eliminate long-standing industry barriers to lower costs. Every industry has legacies and norms that add cost without adding value. Giants like Toyota and Southwest succeeded because they ignored standard industry practice. In the healthcare industry, mavericks such as Intermountain Healthcare and UPMC are doing the same. They’re taking similar approaches to developing protocols, are trying to move from fee-for-service to capitated care, and have created their own insurance companies."

    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "And consider the auto insurance business, where litigation from policyholders is the single largest operating cost. Progressive devised a creative remedy: It introduced a mobile cadre of insurance adjusters who go directly to accident scenes, estimate the damage, and surprise the motorist with a check on the spot. Litigation expense and the cycle time of claims resolution both fell, helping make Progressive one of the few auto insurers that makes money on its core underwriting business, not just its financial portfolio."

      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "Ensure that product design and process design reinforce each other. The more each is developed with the other in mind, the lower the costs of complexity and the greater the potential for a smooth flow of operations. Think about how a good Chinese restaurant can offer a large menu of great dishes and get your food to the table quickly yet charge lower prices than a typical Western restaurant. It’s possible because the product and the process are designed to match perfectly. A Chinese menu is based on a common set of ingredients that are combined in many different ways and are almost all prepared in a wok."

    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Quadrant Homes, a regional home builder in the Pacific Northwest, has some of the lowest prices and costs in the industry. It operates much like a Chinese restaurant. Scheduling at each stage in its value chain is “time-definite” and coordinated to synchronize the serial throughput at each consecutive stage, avoiding idle capacity at any one stage in the system. At the start of the process, new customers configure their desired home on a game-like console from a large set of pre-engineered modular options."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Develop original multipurpose technologies that connect the company to the customer and reduce cost. Low-cost companies’ desire to be different shows up in multipurpose innovations. For example, Quadrant Homes’ house configurator flags any features or dimensions of the desired house that have been chosen by the customer but don’t physically fit together. It also prices out the customer’s selected house. Finally, it records all the building materials to be ordered from suppliers."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "7-Eleven Japan combined its superior ability to capture customer data with AI-driven decision-making in order to know what and when during the day different customer groups buy fresh food. It uses this information to order from suppliers in real time three times a day, making adjustments on the basis of the weather forecast or special events in the area. Customers know they will find what they want on the shelf, and unsold items are minimized."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "Use cycle time and variance as a management tool. Together, cycle time and variance are the best metrics of the operating cost and quality of systems. Cycle time is minutes elapsed per finished unit of any process. Throughput is the number of units per minute—the inverse of cycle time—and determines capacity of the process. Low variance reflects consistently good outcomes, step by step, along the way, which results in high yields and enables shorter work-completion cycles: it means there has been little or no wait time and rework, and few (or no) adverse surprises."

      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "passage": 1,
      "question": "What is the main argument presented in the passage?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The healthcare industry is the most innovative sector for cost reduction.",
        "B": "Successful low-cost companies often achieve their status by challenging established industry norms.",
        "C": "Toyota and Southwest are the only companies that have successfully ignored standard industry practices.",
        "D": "Creating an in-house insurance company is the most effective way to lower costs."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage introduces the central idea that companies like Toyota, Southwest, and certain healthcare 'mavericks' succeed by ignoring costly 'legacies and norms.' This directly supports option B. Options A, C, and D are too specific or are unsupported generalizations based on the examples provided.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For 'Central Idea' questions, look for the statement that encompasses the entire passage's message, not just one of the examples or details."

      "question": "The house configurator at Quadrant Homes is a multipurpose tool; ______ it flags incompatible design choices, prices the final product, and records the necessary building materials.",
      "options": {
        "A": "for instance,",
        "B": "however,",
        "C": "furthermore,",
        "D": "in conclusion,"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The second part of the sentence provides specific examples of what makes the configurator a 'multipurpose tool.' The phrase 'for instance' is used to introduce examples, making it the most logical and grammatically correct choice. 'However' would signal a contrast, 'furthermore' would add a separate point, and 'in conclusion' would signal a summary, none of which fit the sentence's logic.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Pay close attention to the relationship between the two clauses. Is one an example, a contrast, an addition, or a conclusion? The correct transition word will reflect that relationship."

      "question": "As used in the text, the word 'cadre' most nearly means",
      "options": {
        "A": "a large corporation.",
        "B": "an experimental program.",
        "C": "a small, specialized group.",
        "D": "a legal document."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The passage describes a 'mobile cadre of insurance adjusters who go directly to accident scenes.' This context suggests a small group of people trained for a specific task. 'A small, specialized group' is the definition that best fits this context. The other options are inconsistent with the idea of a team of adjusters.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When faced with an unfamiliar word, substitute each answer choice back into the sentence. The one that maintains the original meaning and logic of the sentence is likely correct."

      "skill": "Inferences",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "passage": 2,
      "question": "What can most reasonably be inferred about the traditional auto insurance industry based on the description of Progressive's strategy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It rarely makes a profit from its core business of underwriting.",
        "B": "It has faster claims resolution times than Progressive.",
        "C": "It primarily relies on financial portfolios for revenue, not underwriting.",
        "D": "It considers litigation to be a minor and unavoidable business expense."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The text states that Progressive is 'one of the few auto insurers that makes money on its core underwriting business.' This strongly implies that most other auto insurers do not. Option C is a possibility, but A is a more direct and certain inference from the specific phrasing. Option B is contradicted by the text, and D is incorrect because the text calls litigation the 'single largest operating cost,' not a minor one.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For inference questions, your answer must be directly supported by evidence in the text, even if it's not explicitly stated. Avoid making assumptions that go too far beyond the provided information."

      "question": "7-Eleven Japan’s system allows customers to find what they want, minimizing unsold items. ______ this data-driven approach enhances both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nevertheless,",
        "B": "In other words,",
        "C": "For example,",
        "D": "Consequently,"
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The first sentence describes the positive outcomes of 7-Eleven Japan's system (customers are happy, waste is low). The second sentence states the logical result or consequence of these outcomes (enhanced satisfaction and efficiency). 'Consequently' is the transition word that best shows this cause-and-effect relationship. 'Nevertheless' shows contrast, 'In other words' rephrases, and 'For example' introduces an example.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Identify the logical connection between sentences. Is it cause-and-effect, contrast, emphasis, or illustration? Choose the transition that best signals that specific connection."

      "question": "The discussion of the Chinese restaurant most strongly suggests that some businesses can lower prices while maintaining quality by",
      "options": {
        "A": "hiring a larger number of specialized staff.",
        "B": "offering a limited and unchanging menu of items.",
        "C": "investing heavily in expensive, single-purpose equipment.",
        "D": "standardizing processes and ingredients to maximize efficiency."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The passage emphasizes that a Chinese restaurant uses a 'common set of ingredients' combined in many ways and 'prepared in a wok' with the 'same equipment and sequence of operations.' This points directly to the standardization of both components and processes to create variety efficiently, which is the core idea of option D. Option A is incorrect (efficiency implies less specialized labor), B is incorrect (the text says they offer a 'large menu'), and C is incorrect (the text mentions minimizing 'investment in equipment').",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For questions asking what the text 'most strongly suggests,' break down the example given. Identify the core principles of the example (here, common ingredients, common process) and match them to the more abstract concept in the answer choices."

      "skill": "Text Structure and Purpose",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "passage": 4,
      "question": "The author's primary purpose in comparing Quadrant Homes to a Chinese restaurant is to",
      "options": {
        "A": "argue that home building should be as fast as restaurant service.",
        "B": "illustrate how a complex product can be created efficiently through a standardized, synchronized process.",
        "C": "suggest that both industries suffer from a lack of high-quality materials.",
        "D": "criticize the home building industry for not adopting models from the food service sector."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage highlights how Quadrant Homes uses a 'time-definite' and 'coordinated' process with 'pre-engineered modular options,' much like the Chinese restaurant uses a common set of ingredients and a single cooking method (the wok). The purpose of this comparison is not about speed alone (A) or criticism (D), but to use a familiar analogy to explain a complex business strategy: achieving efficiency in a complex field through standardization and synchronization. This aligns perfectly with option B.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When analyzing an analogy or comparison, ask yourself: 'What specific qualities of the two things being compared are relevant to the author's main point?' The correct answer will focus on that central, relevant similarity."

      "question": "Low variance reflects consistently good outcomes, step by step, along the way, which results in high yields and enables shorter work-completion ______ it means there has been little or no wait time and rework.",

        "B": "cycles, because",
        "C": "cycles; because",
        "D": "cycles because,"
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The word 'because' is a subordinating conjunction that links a dependent clause ('it means there has been...') to an independent clause ('Low variance reflects...'). No punctuation is needed before 'because' when the dependent clause follows the independent clause. Options B and C incorrectly use a comma and semicolon, creating grammatical errors. Option D places the comma incorrectly after 'because.'",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Remember that you generally do not place a comma before a subordinating conjunction like 'because,' 'although,' or 'since' when it connects an independent clause to a following dependent clause."

      "passage": 4,
      "question": "While researching low-cost business models, a student has taken the following notes:<br>- Quadrant Homes is a low-cost home builder.<br>- Their process is 'time-definite,' meaning tasks for the day must be completed.<br>- This approach coordinates different stages of construction to avoid idle capacity.<br>- Customers use a console to choose from pre-engineered modular options.<br>- The goal is to create a smooth, synchronized 'serial throughput.'<br><br>The student wants to write a sentence that emphasizes the connection between Quadrant's customer-facing tools and its operational efficiency. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Quadrant Homes, a low-cost builder, uses a 'time-definite' process with a smooth, synchronized throughput to avoid idle capacity in its value chain.",
        "B": "By having customers select from pre-engineered modular options on a console, Quadrant Homes can standardize its workflow, enabling a 'time-definite,' coordinated schedule that minimizes idle capacity.",
        "C": "To build homes at a low cost, Quadrant Homes has customers use a game-like console to configure their home, after which a synchronized and coordinated building process begins.",
        "D": "The process at Quadrant Homes is defined by its 'serial throughput' and 'time-definite' scheduling, which is made possible by the many modular options available."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This question asks to synthesize the notes to connect the customer tool (the console) with operational efficiency (scheduling, avoiding idle capacity). Option B does this most effectively by explicitly stating a cause-and-effect relationship: the customer selections on the console *enable* the standardized, efficient schedule. Options A and D mention the elements but don't clearly link them. Option C links them but is less precise about *how* the console helps the process.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For Rhetorical Synthesis questions, first identify the specific goal mentioned in the prompt (e.g., 'emphasizes the connection between X and Y'). Then, evaluate which answer choice most clearly and logically establishes that specific relationship using the provided notes."

        "D": "Together, cycle time and variance are the best metrics of the operating cost and quality of systems."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The question asks for the quote that best captures the article's central thesis. The thesis is that successful low-cost companies innovate by breaking from tradition. Option B states this thesis directly and explicitly. Options A and C are specific examples of this principle in action, while option D describes a technical metric used by these companies. Option B is the broadest, most direct statement of the main argument.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When asked to find a quote that supports an 'overarching claim' or 'central thesis,' look for the most general statement that summarizes the author's core message, rather than a specific piece of evidence or a supporting detail."
