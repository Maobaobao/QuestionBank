### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of Essay (markdown format), **"What Sets Inspirational Leaders Apart" by Bent Flyvbjerg (Harvard Business Review USA, March-April, 2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Here is the article:

Infuriating leaders ignore, diminish, and control others. Inspiring leaders empower, elevate, and empathize with their teams. Confucius perfectly captures the positive effects of the latter approach to managing: “Tell me and I will forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I will understand.”

Inspiring leaders share leadership responsibilities—for example, by letting team members run or help run meetings. Sherry Wu of UCLA has done numerous field experiments comparing boss-led meetings with worker-led ones and has found that just 20 minutes a week of the latter boosts employee productivity and satisfaction and reduces turnover. I apply that in my doctoral seminars: Each week a different student helps guide the class discussion.

We all crave someone who values us, celebrates us, and guides us to be the best version of ourselves. Good mentoring requires understanding that different people have different needs at different times and really listening to what those needs are. It also involves sharing credit for successes and taking blame for failures, which makes us truly admired and respected.

How can you prepare to mentor? First, look to those below you in a hierarchy for new ideas and knowledge. Ting Zhang, Dan Wang, and I found that reflecting on a time when you learned from someone at a lower level can make you more engaged with others and more likely to offer thoughtful and wellcalibrated advice, which enhances the mentee experience. Second, practice perspective taking, or looking at the world through the eyes of others, which has been shown to enhance empathy.

Here’s a prompt you might use: Look at the world from the vantage point of a colleague. What motivates and what challenges that person?

Empathy and the desire to keep his employees from enduring the hardship of job loss drove the CEO’s creative solution. He also displayed empathy in his plea that people support one another and by patiently answering dozens of questions. Similarly, Dipak showed compassion for our accused colleague and shared our anger at the anonymous allegation. He listened to our complaints but then helped us understand that a thorough investigation was in fact the best course of action for both the professor and the school.

Each of us has the potential to be more inspiring. We can all learn to be visionary, an exemplar, and an empathetic mentor.

But how can you stay inspiring or become more so over time? My research points to four key actions: reflect, emulate, intend, and practice, or REIP. The acronym is a homonym for “reap” because I believe that leadership, like sowing seed, produces either a good or a bad crop.

Let’s start with reflection. Once a month reflect on when you were inspiring— and when you may have been infuriating. When did you see, or fail to see, the big picture? When was your message simple and visual, and when was it confusing? When were you anxious and cowardly in crisis, or listless and inauthentic, rather than calm, courageous, and passionate? When did you empower, elevate, and empathize with others—or fail to do so? Next, think about an inspiring leader from your own life and how you might emulate that person. Tap into that wellspring of hope and possibility. Then pinpoint exactly what it was about the person that motivated you. How might you replicate that behavior and inspire the same reaction?

Now turn your reflections and emulations into intentions. Make a commitment, even a small one, to a specific behavior you will adopt in the next month to be more visionary, a better exemplar, or a more effective mentor.

Finally, practice being inspiring in your everyday life. For example, whenever you’re speaking to a team you want to energize, think about how to simplify and visualize your message so that over time you come to do it naturally. Or engage in daily breathing exercises to help you stay calm even under duress.

Here is one daily practice that is guaranteed to inspire those around you: Every morning, reach out to at least one coworker and praise that person for a task done well or say thank you for making your life easier. A CEO told me that it takes him only minutes a day over his morning coffee to elevate someone in his orbit—and it brightens not only that person’s day but also his own. His missives receive effusive, grateful replies that put a spring in his step. That illustrates the virtuous circle of inspirational leadership.
