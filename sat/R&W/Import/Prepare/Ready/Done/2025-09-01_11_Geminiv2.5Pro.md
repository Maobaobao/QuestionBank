The Sound Lounge, a dimly lit enclave tucked into downtown Minneapolis, exuded an air of curated intimacy as Evan and Drew sank into one of its listening booths. The bar offered patrons a rare indulgence: the chance to slip on a pair of luxury headphones and lose themselves in music. Fritch Audio had outfitted the venue with its finest gear when it first opened; in exchange, the founders got a VIP booth and liberal pours of whiskey whenever they visited.

Evan had sketched out his promotion offer when they’d arrived but had asked Drew to give him some time to process the news on his own. Now their heads were nodding to Pink Floyd’s “Time” through the Focal Utopia headphones that ran through Fritch Audio’s digitalto- analog converter. They often chose the song for its layered textures and shifting dynamics—the perfect vehicle, they felt, to showcase their equipment.

Evan glanced at Drew, who was lost in the song, eyes closed and a smile on his face. His friend and partner lived and breathed music, spending his spare time restoring vintage audio equipment and hunting for rare vinyl. Together, they had grown Fritch from a passion project into a $5 million venture, beloved by audiophiles around the world. Yet despite the impressive revenue, the profits were slim, and the company didn’t seem to be gaining any more traction.

Both men jumped as the 230-pound frame of Phil Warner plonked down in the booth across from them, disrupting their musical reverie. “There they are!” Phil said loudly, his voice booming over the quiet hum of the bar. “The maestros themselves! I’ve been dying to meet with you guys.”

“Evan, this is Phil,” Drew said. “As I told you, he’s a real estate developer who heard about us from his daughter, who’s a Fritch customer.”

“Yep,” Phil said. “I looked at my credit card bill and saw how much she was spending on your equipment and thought, It would be cheaper for me just to buy the company!”

Evan and Drew exchanged a glance as Phil laughed heartily and then leaned forward. “Let me cut to the chase. I’ve done a lot of research on you guys and your competitors, and I’ve looked over the business plan, marketing docs, and financials that Drew forwarded. I like what I see. I’d like to make a $1 million investment in Fritch Audio. All I ask is that we set out a strategy together to grow Fritch to $15 million in revenue and double the margins. Well, that and a 15% stake in the company!”

Evan laughed awkwardly as Drew pulled the headphones from around his neck. “There’s a world out there that hasn’t even heard your name,” Phil continued, his voice lowering as if he were sharing a secret. “We can take this global, reach new ears, without losing the edge that makes you the best.”

His excitement building, he continued. “I think you guys could have the most powerful soundstage in the world,” he said, misusing a term he’d clearly picked up secondhand. Evan caught Drew’s eye again, and a subtle grin flickered between them.

Phil paused mid-sentence, reading the room with a salesman’s instinct. He chuckled, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Alright, alright. I’ll stick to what I know. You keep making the magic; I’ll help turn this into a serious business.” Evan’s thoughts reeled, the offer triggering a now-familiar mix of pride and dread. “I’m honored, Phil. Truly. But the timing…I’ve just been offered a promotion at my day job.”

“I get it,” Phil said. “Stability, loyalty— that’s important. But I envision great things for Fritch. Opportunities like this don’t come around too often.” He paused to let the message land. “I guess it’s a question of whether you want to build a real company or just play at it.”

The hum of the bar seemed to grow louder. Drew’s eyes shone with encouragement and urgency, a silent reminder of everything they’d built and what could come next. Evan looked down, feeling the pull of two opposing futures.
