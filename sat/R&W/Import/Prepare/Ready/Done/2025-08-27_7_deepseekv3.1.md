Here is the article:
"

That’s the good news for women. But as soon as they cross the graduation threshold, something strange happens: They immediately lose their advantage. In the United States

women represent only 48% of employees entering the corporate workforce—and when the first promotions to manager come around, only 81 women are promoted for every 100 men. This means that over the course of five years one million women will fall behind right at the start of their careers, held back by a broken rung at the bottom of the corporate ladder. Not only that, but women continue to lose ground throughout their careers: At the senior manager/director level, their representation falls to 37%; at the VP level, to 34%, and at the senior VP and C-suite level, to 29%. The numbers are even more extreme for women of color, who collectively make up only 7% of C-suite executives today. We see a similar drop-off for women at senior levels of leadership globally.

All of this raises some familiar questions: How is it possible, four decades after achieving parity in education, that women are still so far from achieving it in the workplace? If they’re beginning their careers just as qualified as or even more qualified than men, shouldn’t that translate into better representation all the way up the professional ladder? Why do these stubborn gender gaps exist in the workplace, especially at senior levels?

One of the big reasons is that education and entry-level skills get you only halfway to your full earning potential. The rest is based on knowledge, skills, and wisdom gained on the job. We call this experience capital. To understand how men and women build experience capital differently, we analyzed about 86,000 professional profiles in the United States, using longitudinal data to trace actual career trajectories. Interestingly, our analysis shows that women move from role to role and learn new skills just as frequently as men do. However, men are more likely to move to growing occupations from shrinking ones. Their moves are also more likely to increase their pay than moves made by women, who often see a decrease in pay.

Experience capital can be gained through employerprovided learning and development programs, through job changes that challenge you to add new skills to your repertoire, and by observing how colleagues and bosses handle complex tasks or tricky situations. But building experience capital isn’t the only challenge; the other half of the equation is having it recognized in the form of new opportunities, promotions, and compensation increases.

Our research has shown that women aren’t earning the same amount of experience capital as men. There are multiple systemic issues at work here that need to be addressed if we want to solve this problem, including biases in hiring and promotion, but in the meantime there’s plenty that women can do to help themselves. That’s what this article is about: the actions that women can take. By distilling what we’ve learned in more than a decade of research and through interviews with successful female leaders, we’ve developed a set of strategies and practices for developing experience capital that can help women set themselves up for success—in a way that will benefit not just them but also the people and companies they work with.

The organizations you join at the start of your career can have a profound impact on your success. In our research we’ve found that early exposure to an effective organization that supports employees’ growth—ideally within the first five working years—accounts for 50% of the variation in experience capital among workers, on average.

To identify companies that will help you boost your experience capital, look for these traits.

A strong learning culture. Seek out companies in which all employees, new and long-tenured, are offered education and training—and are actively encouraged to take advantage of them by leaders who prioritize their growth. Such organizations also often promote peer learning and set the expectation that employees will take responsibility for developing one another.

Successful competitive strategy. Identify organizations that have a clear strategy for winning in their industry and execute it systematically—whether it is driving innovation, involving employees in continuous improvement, being very attuned to the market and its changes, or building a broad set of leaders and general managers. High and cross-functional mobility. A company that actively helps employees move into new roles internally increases their experience capital. In such firms workers develop greater agility and feel that their organization invests in and values them, which increases engagement and retention.

Diversity. People are more likely to learn new things and be innovative and creative when they have colleagues who differ from them. Organizations with leadership teams that reflect diverse cultures and genders are more likely to make better decisions and be open to continuous improvement, which can increase their employees’ experience capital. (Note that we’ve found only that these benefits are correlated with diversity; it’s not possible to put a company through a double-blind test to prove causation.)

The question, of course, is how to identify companies that actually possess these traits. The most obvious places to start are company websites and the information that companies’ HR departments make available. It’s always a good idea to talk to people who work in the organizations and to compare what they tell you with what you find out through external sources, such as media outlets or websites like Glassdoor and Indeed. You can ask questions like these: What are the core values of the company, and how do leaders walk the talk each day? How many hours a year (or what percentage of time) are employees encouraged to invest in their personal learning? How does that learning actually happen, and what company support and resources are there to ensure that it happens? What is the promotion structure? How high is employee turnover? What percentage of employees make cross-functional moves within the organization? What kinds of formal sponsorship and mentorship pro grams exist?

When interviewing for a job, never forget that it’s a twoway process: The people at a company may be interviewing you, but you’re also interviewing them. Outside the interview process, seek every possible opportunity to speak to current and former employees. Find out about the culture. Learn everything you can about the CEO, the executive team, and your future boss: What are their values and leadership styles, and how do they interact with others? Consider the board of directors, too. How diverse is it in terms of background and expertise? Board members, after all, are the people who shape the organization from the very top.
