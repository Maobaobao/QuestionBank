    {
      "passage_number": 1,
      "text": "In 2021, the Maryland Department of Health and the state police were confronting a crisis: Fatal drug overdoses in the state were at an all-time high, and authorities didn't know why. There was a general sense that it had something to do with changes in the supply of illicit drugs-and specifically of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has caused overdose deaths in the US to roughly double over the past decade, to more than 100,000 per year."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "But Maryland officials were flying blind when it came to understanding these fluctuations in anything close to real time. The US Drug Enforcement Administration reported on the purity of drugs recovered in enforcement operations, but the DEA's data offered limited detail and typically came back six to nine months after the seizures. By then, the actual drugs on the street had morphed many times over."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "Part of the investigative challenge was that fentanyl can be some 50 times more potent than heroin, and inhaling even a small amount can be deadly. This made conventional methods of analysis, which required handling the contents of drug packages directly, incredibly risky."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Seeking answers, Maryland officials turned to scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the national metrology institute for the United States, which defines and maintains standards of measurement essential to a wide range of industrial sectors and health and security applications."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "There, a research chemist named Ed Sisco and his team had developed methods for detecting trace amounts of drugs, explosives, and other dangerous materials-techniques that could protect law enforcement officials and others who had to collect these samples. Essentially, Sisco's lab had fine-tuned a technology called DART (for 'direct analysis in real time') mass spectrometry-which the US Transportation Security Administration uses to test for explosives by swiping your hand-to enable the detection of even tiny traces of chemicals collected from an investigation site."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "This meant that nobody had to open a bag or handle unidentified powders; a usable residue sample could be obtained by simply swiping the outside of the bag. Sisco realized that first responders or volunteers at needle exchange sites could use these same methods to safely collect drug residue from bags, drug paraphernalia, or used test strips-which also meant they would no longer need to wait for law enforcement to seize drugs for testing."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "They could then safely mail the samples to NIST's lab in Maryland and get results back in as little as 24 hours, thanks to innovations in Sisco's lab that shaved the time to generate a complete report from 10 to 30 minutes to just one or two. This was partly enabled by algorithms that allowed them to skip the time-consuming step of separating the compounds in a sample before running an analysis."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 8,
      "text": "The Rapid Drug Analysis and Research (RaDAR) program launched as a pilot in October 2021 and uncovered new, critical information almost immediately. Early analysis found xylazine-a veterinary sedative that's been associated with gruesome wounds in users-in about 80% of opioid samples they collected."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 9,
      "text": "This was a significant finding, Sisco says: 'Forensic labs care about things that are illegal, not things that are not illegal but do potentially cause harm. Xylazine is not a scheduled compound, but it leads to wounds that can lead to amputation, and it makes the other drugs more dangerous.'"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 10,
      "text": "In addition to the compounds that are known to appear in high concentrations in street drugs-xylazine, fentanyl, and the veterinary sedative medetomidine-NIST's technology can pick out trace amounts of dozens of adulterants that swirl through the street-drug supply and can make it more dangerous, including acetaminophen, rat poison, and local anesthetics like lidocaine."
