      "text": "For her birthday, Amina asked to go on a trip. Her husband had travelled for work the previous month, and, although that wasn’t exactly for pleasure, it was now understood that anything which freed them from child care could be considered some type of holiday. Besides, they were trying to allow each other leisurely activities— evenings out, morning runs, a movie from time to time. And, recently, nights away. They wanted to find ways of easing back into their life, which had been on hold since the baby was born."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "It was so simple to slip into that old self, free of obligations; the exchange happened so naturally. Amina was already bored in the half hour she had to wait at the train station in Lyon, even though such time was hard to come by. She bought a coffee and a pack of biscuits, then sat on a bench, scrolling restlessly on her phone. Though this was her first trip away from the baby, who had recently turned one, it didn’t really feel momentous. It felt, rather, as if she were putting on a coat she hadn’t worn in a long time, whose shape and texture she remembered immediately."

      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "She was going to Marseille to meet her university friends Alba and Lisa, with whom she had studied in England. They were travelling from Madrid and Zurich and would arrive at the rental apartment at around the same time as Amina. It was Lisa who’d arranged everything—set the dates, booked an apartment, compiled a list of restaurants and neighborhoods they should go to. Amina and Alba had reverted to their old joke that Lisa was their travel agent; she’d account for their hours of sleep, for every minute in the bathroom."

    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Amina hadn’t seen her friends since her pregnancy. They used to visit regularly after Amina and her husband moved to Lyon seven years ago... But Lisa and Alba were exceptionally busy in the months after the birth. This was what they’d said, when they apologized for not yet having met the baby. Their weekends were booked for months ahead. Amina had barely left the confines of her neighborhood that year, and she had thought with some bitterness that Alba and Lisa didn’t know what real busyness meant."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Their friendship had always operated in leisure: long meals, afternoon drinks, dressing up to go dancing. Amina wanted to see them on these same terms, rather than be disappointed by interrupted conversations and her friends’ possible lack of interest in her daughter. She herself had never paid attention to friends’ babies before; she only surveyed the mothers. She noted the physical changes, their waning interests, trying to project what might become of her in the future were she to have a child."

      "question": "The narrator indicates that Amina and her husband view a trip primarily as a way to",
      "options": {
        "A": "celebrate a special occasion.",
        "B": "reclaim a sense of personal freedom.",
        "C": "escape professional responsibilities.",
        "D": "reconnect with each other romantically."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage states that 'anything which freed them from child care could be considered some type of holiday' and that they are 'easing back into their life, which had been on hold.' This supports the inference that the primary value of the trip is the freedom from parental obligations.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For inference questions, look for the underlying meaning or implication stated by the narrator, not just the surface-level action."

      "question": "As used in the passage, the phrase 'scrolling restlessly' most nearly means",
      "options": {
        "A": "searching with frantic energy.",
        "B": "moving without focused attention.",
        "C": "navigating with technical skill.",
        "D": "reading with intense curiosity."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The context clues are 'already bored' and the fact that this free time was 'hard to come by,' yet she is not using it purposefully. 'Restlessly' implies a lack of calm or purpose, and 'scrolling' is an unfocused action, making 'moving without focused attention' the best fit.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For 'Words in Context' questions, treat the phrase as a single unit and test each answer choice in the sentence to see which one preserves the original meaning and tone."

      "options": {
        "A": "To emphasize the unfamiliarity and discomfort of being alone.",
        "B": "To illustrate the outdated nature of her pre-motherhood identity.",

        "D": "To suggest that her freedom is merely a temporary covering."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The simile is used to explain why the trip 'didn’t really feel momentous.' The coat's 'shape and texture she remembered immediately' shows that returning to her old, child-free self was a seamless and familiar process, not a difficult or dramatic one.",

      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The passage contrasts Lisa's hyper-organized actions ('arranged everything,' 'account for every minute') with the more passive roles of Amina and Alba, who revert to their 'old joke.' This establishes a character contrast that is a recurring feature of their friendship dynamic.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "To determine how a detail serves the whole, ask yourself: 'What does this description reveal about the characters or the situation?'"

      "question": "The writer wants to clearly express the relationship between Amina's experience and her perception of her friends' lives. Which choice most effectively connects the two sentences?<br><br>'Amina had barely left the confines of her neighborhood that year.

        "D": "Nevertheless,"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Amina's confined experience is the direct cause of her bitter thought about her friends. 'Therefore' correctly signals this cause-and-effect relationship. 'Moreover' would add a similar point, 'For example' would illustrate the previous point, and 'Nevertheless' would signal a contrast, all of which are incorrect here.",

      "passage": 4,
      "question": "The passage suggests that Amina's 'bitterness' stems primarily from a feeling of",

        "A": "resentment that her friends failed to support her during a difficult time.",
        "B": "frustration that her friends' definition of 'busyness' seems trivial compared to her own.",

        "D": "disappointment that her friends did not prioritize meeting her baby."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "While (A) and (D) are plausible, the text focuses on the word 'busyness.' Amina, who is truly confined and busy with an infant, feels her friends' use of the same term to describe their social calendars is invalid. The bitterness is rooted in this perceived inequity of experience, not merely a missed visit.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Hard inference questions require synthesizing multiple details. Don't choose the most obvious answer; choose the one most strongly and specifically supported by the nuanced evidence in the text."

      "question": "As used in the passage, 'surveyed' most nearly means",
      "options": {
        "A": "measured land.",
        "B": "examined critically.",
        "C": "collected data from.",
        "D": "supervised officially."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In this context, Amina is not literally collecting data (C) or measuring land (A). She is observing the mothers with a specific, analytical purpose: to 'note[] the physical changes, their waning interests' to predict her own future. This critical, scrutinizing examination is best captured by 'examined critically.'",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For high-difficulty vocabulary questions, the common definition is often a trap. Focus on how the word is functioning in its specific textual context."

        "A": "The conflict between maintaining old friendships and embracing new responsibilities.",
        "B": "The struggle to reconcile one's past identity with one's present reality.",
        "C": "The difficulty of preserving leisure activities after having a child.",
        "D": "The fear of being judged by friends for life choices."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The entire passage contrasts the 'leisure' of her old friendship with her new reality as a mother. She wants to see her friends on the 'same terms' (past identity) but fears the reality of 'interrupted conversations' (present reality). Her act of 'surveying' other mothers shows her trying to project her future self, further highlighting this tension between who she was and who she is becoming.",

        "A": "provide a humorous counterpoint to Amina's serene journey.",
        "B": "reinforce the theme of parental responsibility that Amina is temporarily escaping.",
        "C": "foreshadow a potential argument between Amina and her friends.",
        "D": "illustrate a universal experience that creates solidarity among mothers."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Amina has just slipped into her 'old self, free of obligations.' The woman on the train is a direct representation of the obligations (the 'frenzied attempts' to get a baby to nap) she has left behind. It reinforces what she has escaped, which is why she considers speaking to the woman but decides against it—it would mean re-engaging with that world.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For 'Cross-Text' or function questions within a passage, consider how the detail relates to the broader themes and the protagonist's journey or state of mind."

        "D": "She herself had never paid attention to friends’ babies before..."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The question asks for insight about her *past* self. While (B) and (C) describe her past *actions*, only (D) provides the key *insight*: that her focus was never on the babies themselves. This realization now informs her understanding of her friends' potential 'lack of interest' and her own past behavior, making it the most effective choice for the summary.",
