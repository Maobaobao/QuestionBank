      "text": "“Why were you reading trash fiction? You would have been a bright child, didn’t you go to the library?” I said I was too little to go to the library by myself. There was a children’s library near our house and my mother would take me there. But I didn’t like children’s books, they bored me. “And your mother didn’t realize how precocious you were, that you weren’t being challenged?” I said I was pretty sure she had realized it, but she might not have wanted to encourage it. “She didn’t want to expose you to things you might not have been able to handle?” I said maybe something like that, I didn’t know. In any case, the war came and we left and there was no question of libraries until after we came home."

      "text": "I said that my reaction to the war was another case of having been in retrospect overly apprehensive. “Can you expand on that reaction?” I said in some ways it (the war) began for me when my brother was born, in December 1929. My mother was in the hospital for two weeks. The hospital did not allow visits from children. I felt quite alone, left out. “Abandoned,” he said. In a way, I said. Then she came home, and everything was a little different, and I didn’t react well. My father and I had been very close—I spent a lot of those first five years just driving around with him, visiting relatives or dropping by ranches or whatever—and after my brother was born this dynamic changed. Plus, the war was always on the horizon. I would hear Daddy talking about enlisting. Which he did, before war was declared. When he went away I was sad for a long time, I stopped growing, the pediatrician called it “failure to thrive” and recommended to Mother that we join him if possible. It was possible, he was only at Fort Lewis then, so we did. Then we went to Durham, then to Colorado Springs."

      "text": "These were for a child disordered times. There was always difficulty getting trains. I remember there were no seats on the train between New Orleans and Durham, we stood up in the vestibule where the cars coupled. There was always difficulty finding somewhere to live. The first and one of the few times I ever saw my mother cry was coming out of a military housing office in either Tacoma or Durham. In Durham my father was billeted at Duke, and Mother and my brother and I lived in one room in a Baptist preacher’s house, with kitchen privileges. This family was strange to me, exotic. The children sat under the back stoop eating dirt, I later learned it was common in poor areas of the south, the result of a nutritional deficiency."

      "text": "“But your father was getting a salary, why did you live that way?” I pointed out that this was 1942. Every place the military was stationed was overcrowded. It wasn’t a question of money. It was a question of no place to live. “You must have been afraid your father would be sent overseas, maybe die.” I said I was. He talked about going overseas all the time. He seemed ashamed that he kept getting orders for one after another office job in safe places. This feeling on his part seemed especially acute in Colorado Springs, because this was a base on which other people were actually in harm’s way—fliers from Petersen were always crashing, but he wasn’t a flier."

    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "When he left Petersen for Cleveland and Detroit we went home. Except we didn’t have a house anymore, they had sold it. So my mother and brother and I lived with my grandmother until the war ended and Daddy came home, at which point they built a house, but finding the property and getting the house built took probably another year of living with my grandmother. That was a difficult time for Daddy. During the time he was away, Mother had seemed to work out a very contented life with her mother."

      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "“Was your grandfather dead?” No, I said, but he was away from Sunday afternoon until Friday night. She lived in Sacramento, he worked in Marysville. That was their M.O. So it was really a house of women, until Daddy came home. “There must have been tension. You must have felt it.” I said there had been tension, that in fact I had later learned from Mother that it was a period when they considered divorce. “There has to have been a level at which you knew that. Witness your divorce fantasy.” I said there might or might not have been a level at which I knew it, but in point of fact the divorce fantasy was much earlier, before the war."

    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "“I’m suggesting that the tension may not have arrived out of nowhere in 1945. That you felt it much earlier, even before the war. Sensitive children are extraordinarily attuned to domestic tension, things they hear at the dinner table.” I said I supposed that all children were so attuned. And they had no way of interpreting what they picked up. They had no way of understanding the normal give and take of adult relationships, normal differences of opinion. “Children have different ways of handling this. Some children close it off, refuse to hear it, don’t remember it later.” I said that my brother remembered nothing about our childhood. I could not engage him in a conversation about his life before college if our lives depended on it. Of course he was only four, but his entire memory of Colorado Springs is a dead certainty that we left because he saw a spider in a packing box. “That’s something like believing the tension in your household began when the war ended.” I said nothing."

      "text": "“I think you grew up believing that you were on the brink of disaster. That you were about to lose your father. I think you were anticipating the loss of your father your entire life. Until he died. Which is why I think you took his death harder than you thought you did.”<br><br>Let’s for the sake of argument, I said, assume that this is true. It’s certainly true that I have always been extremely apprehensive. The reasons for my being apprehensive may not be as important as the simple fact that I have been. Here’s what I don’t understand: what has this got to do with Quintana? What is she getting from me that troubles her? I accept that she’s getting something, that’s what she tells Dr. Kass, that’s why I’m talking to you."
