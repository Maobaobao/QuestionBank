      "text": "While sustained profitable growth is a nearly universal goal, it is an elusive one for many companies. Empirical research that I and others have conducted on the long-term patterns of growth in U.S. corporations suggests that when inflation is taken into account, most companies barely grow. For instance, in an analysis of 10,897 publicly held U.S. companies from 1976 to 2019, my research associate Catherine Piner and I found that firms in the top quartile grew at an inflation-adjusted average of 11.8% per year, but those in the lower three quartiles experienced little or no growth (0.3%, 0.03%, and -0.5%, respectively). And the majority of firms in the top quartile were unable to sustain superior growth performance for more than a few years.<br><br>Although challenging to achieve, sustained profitable growth is not impossible, however. In our analysis, we found that only about 15% of the companies in the top growth quartile in 1985 were able to sustain their top-quartile performance for at least 30 years. Over the past two decades, I have tried to understand why some companies are more effective at sustaining growth and what senior leaders can do to navigate the organizational challenges it poses."

      "text": "I have found that while the usual explanations for slow or minimal growth—market forces and technological changes such as disruptive innovation— play a role, many companies’ growth problems are self-inflicted. Specifically, firms approach growth in a highly reactive, opportunistic manner. When market demand is booming, they go on hiring binges, throw resources at developing new capacity, and build out organizational infrastructure without thinking through the implications."

      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "In the process of chasing growth, companies can easily destroy the things that made them successful in the first place, such as their capacity for innovation, their agility, their great customer service, or their unique cultures. When demand slows, pressures to maintain historical growth rates can lead to quick-fix solutions such as costly acquisitions or drastic cuts in R&D, other capabilities, and training. The damage caused by these moves only exacerbates the growth problems."

    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Sustaining profitable growth requires a delicate balance between the pursuit of market opportunities (demand) and the creation of the capabilities and capacity needed to exploit those opportunities (supply). To proactively manage that balance, companies need a growth strategy that explicitly addresses three interrelated decisions: how fast to grow (the target rate of growth); where to seek new sources of demand (the direction of growth); and how to amass the financial, human, and organizational resources needed to grow (the method of growth)."

      "options": {
        "A": "0.3%",
        "B": "0.03%",
        "C": "11.8%",
        "D": "-0.5%"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The passage explicitly states: 'firms in the top quartile grew at an inflation-adjusted average of 11.8% per year.' The other options are the growth rates for the lower three quartiles.",

      "question": "Based on the information in the passage, the author's research over the past two decades was primarily motivated by a desire to:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Prove that sustained growth is impossible for most firms.",
        "B": "Identify the factors that enable long-term superior growth.",
        "C": "Criticize companies in the lower growth quartiles.",
        "D": "Promote a specific consulting framework to businesses."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage states the author has tried 'to understand why some companies are more effective at sustaining growth,' which directly aligns with identifying the factors behind long-term superior growth. The author acknowledges growth is challenging but not impossible (contradicting A), and the tone is analytical, not critical (C) or promotional (D).",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Inference questions require you to draw a logical conclusion based on evidence in the text, not on outside knowledge or assumptions."

        "C": "aggressive",
        "D": "calculating"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The context contrasts a 'reactive, opportunistic manner' with the need for proactive management later in the article. A reactive approach is one that merely responds to external events (like booming demand) rather than planning for them. 'Responsive' is the best synonym in this context.",

        "D": "receive strong support from senior leadership and the board."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage clearly states that 'quick-fix solutions' lead to 'damage' which 'only exacerbates the growth problems.' This directly supports choice B.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Focus on cause-and-effect relationships stated in the text. Keywords like 'exacerbates' signal that one action is worsening a problem."

        "D": "warn against the potential dangers of rapid expansion."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The passage first identifies the problem: growth requires a 'delicate balance.' It then proposes the solution: companies 'need a growth strategy' that addresses three key decisions. It does not summarize data (B), refute a belief (C), or solely issue a warning (D); it moves toward a solution.",

        "D": "reveals"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The context describes 'damage' caused by certain moves. The logical effect of damage is to make a pre-existing problem (growth problems) more severe. Therefore, 'exacerbates' means 'worsens.' 'Mitigates' (A) is an antonym.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Tackle tough vocabulary questions by examining the sentence's logic. The word 'damage' is a strong contextual clue that the result will be negative and intensifying."

        "D": "assess its ability to attract the human capital needed for delivery."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage criticizes a 'reactive, opportunistic manner' and specifically cites going on 'hiring binges' without thinking through implications as a example of a problematic, self-inflicted approach. Therefore, a successful company would be least likely to do this. The other options (A, C, D) are all listed as implications companies *should* think through but fail to.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For complex inference questions, find the negative example in the text. The question 'LEAST likely' asks for the action that is most contrary to the author's recommended approach."

        "A": "The data provides a counterexample that disproves the claim.",
        "B": "The data establishes a general context that makes the claim notable.",
        "C": "The data is unrelated to the central argument of the claim.",
        "D": "The data offers a solution to the problem presented in the claim."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The first passage uses data to establish that sustained growth is 'elusive' for most companies. The second passage begins with 'Although challenging to achieve...' acknowledging this context, and then makes the notable claim that it is 'not impossible,' supported by the specific statistic about 15% of companies. The data sets up the problem that makes the subsequent claim meaningful.",

        "D": "contrast his framework with traditional economic models."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The phrases 'pursuit of market opportunities' and 'creation of the capabilities and capacity' are descriptive. The parentheticals '(demand)' and '(supply)' provide concise, clarifying labels for these concepts, making the subsequent discussion of 'balance' clearer for the reader.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "In Rhetorical Synthesis questions, analyze the author's choices. Parentheticals are often used for clarification, definition, or providing brief examples—not to minimize importance."

        "D": "emphasize that customer service is the most important factor for growth."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The core of the author's argument is that companies' growth problems are 'self-inflicted.' The sentence points out the irony that in the very 'process of chasing growth,' companies can destroy their original strengths (like innovation and agility), which is a self-defeating outcome. This strengthens the author's main critique.",
