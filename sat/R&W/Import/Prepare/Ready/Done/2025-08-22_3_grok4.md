## Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Understand the SAT Reading and Writing Domains and Skills**
Refer to the SAT Reading and Writing guide provided. Ensure the questions align with the **four content domains** and their respective skills:

- **Information and Ideas**: Measures comprehension, analysis, and reasoning skills and knowledge and the ability to locate, interpret, evaluate, and integrate information and ideas from texts and informational graphics (tables, bar graphs, and line graphs).
  - Central Ideas and Details
  - Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)
  - Inferences
- **Craft and Structure**: Measures the comprehension, vocabulary, analysis, synthesis, and reasoning skills and knowledge needed to understand and use high-utility words and phrases in context, evaluate texts rhetorically, and make connections between topically related texts.
  - Words in Context
  - Text Structure and Purpose
  - Cross-Text Connections
- **Expression of Ideas**: Measures the ability to revise texts to improve the effectiveness of written expression and to meet specific rhetorical goals.
  - Rhetorical Synthesis
  - Transitions
- **Standard English Conventions**: Measures the ability to edit text to conform to core conventions of Standard English sentence structure, usage, and punctuation.

### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of Essay (markdown format), **"Are friends electric?" by Bryan Gardiner. (MIT Technology Review, March-April,2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

The talking-machine demonstrations, although highly choreographed, were a hit with visitors and the press­so much so that people seemed willing to attribute far more understanding and autonomy to the Voder than was warranted. Even though the Voderette was in full view during the entire demonstration, the press usually mentioned the woman responsible for making the sounds only in passing, if at all.
Instead, the Voder was anthropomorphized and granted a high degree of agency. “He hasn’t any mouth, lungs, or larynx­but he talks a blue streak,” wrote Popular Science.

From the Voder and Elektro the Moto-Man to Speak & Spell and Perfect Paul to Alexa and Siri, Vox ex Machina showcases both the products of voice synthesis and the underlying technologies that made them possible. It’s a fascinating tour, particularly when Bell focuses on the ways in which the public’s reaction to these “talking machines” presaged its reaction to the “thinking” ones that would emerge decades later. While the practice of describing humans with machine metaphors and machines with human metaphors dates back centuries, the ability of machines to simulate human speech (however poorly) “gave machinic personification a new inflection,” writes Bell.

In other words, the more machines could “speak” and “think,” the more we started to think of ourselves as machines. Indeed, one can’t help but see striking parallels to what’s happening with today’s artificial intelligence­specifically, our willingness to reduce or minimize what makes us human to better conform to whatever “intelligent” attribute a product may be demonstrating. Sam Altman’s response to the fact that LLMs are just really good word calculators? “i am a stochastic parrot, and so r u.”

The Voder may have been one of the first crude attempts at speech synthesis, but the disconnect between the way it worked (with a lot of human training and labor) and the way the public and press perceived it (as a more or less autonomous machine with its own voice) foreshadowed a problem we still face today. In Waiting for Robots: The Hired Hands of Automation, Antonio A. Casilli argues that despite claims to the contrary, human input remains a crucial component of all modern automation and artificial-intelligence tools, regardless of their sophistication. The difference is that instead of this role being obvious­as was the case with the Voderettes­it’s now hidden, and usually on purpose.

Casilli is a sociology professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Paris who studies the unseen and unacknowledged “digital labor” that undergirds many of today’s social media platforms, microtask sites, and on-demand services. Rather than viewing automation and AI as destroyers of human jobs, he makes a convincing case that they merely result in the further atomization of work, fracturing it into smaller, more meaningless, more demeaning tasks for many of us. “Forget about losing jobs to automation,” he writes. “Remarkably, the reality is that humans steal the jobs of robots.”

Whether it’s Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a service for recruiting hundreds of thousands of micro-taskers to perform video-filtering and image-tagging tasks that machines can’t do, or the perpetual human “supervision” and “reinforcement” required for automated learning and AI training, Casilli gives readers plenty of examples of how human labor much of it coming from Asian, Latin American, and African countries props up­or, in some cases, pretends to actually be­intelligent
systems and products.

Ultimately, Casilli is less concerned that robots will replace white-collar workers, and more worried that thousands of lower-paid or unpaid digital workers will. As he points out, we are already unwittingly being recruited by companies to collectively perform millions of hours of free work every year. Take the aforementioned captchas: Google, which owns and deploys one of the most popular versions of the service ReCAPTCHA and No CAPTCHA, has been using this digital labor for more than a decade. The results help detect house numbers to improve Google Street View, digitize texts for Google Books, and train its computer vision algorithms to detect locations and reconstruct scenes, enhancing Google Images and improving the performance of Waymo’s self-driving cars. “The irony here is that a service that is supposed to distinguish humans from robots is actually making humans work to produce more robots,” Casilli writes.

While all the hype and hyperbole surrounding today’s AI tools can feel unprecedented, Casilli reminds readers that such rhetoric isn’t really new at all. Robots, automation, and various intelligent systems have been just on the verge of taking over all aspects of our work lives and cultural output for decades now. In the end, artificial intelligence is a technological process that isn’t actually artificial, he says. Peer behind the curtains of smooth and seamless efficiency, and it’s humans all the way down.

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
- In the questions, answers, explanations and score improvement tip, **don't show the passage number**.
