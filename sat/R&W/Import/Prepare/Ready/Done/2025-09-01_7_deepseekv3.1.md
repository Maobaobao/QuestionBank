### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of Essay (markdown format), **"How Salespeople Game the System" by Timothy M. Gardner. (Harvard Business Review USA, March-April, 2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

This typology of tactics can help sales leaders and incentive plan managers think like gamers when looking for signs of cheating in existing incentive plans and when designing and rolling out new ones. The effectiveness of this process will vary according to managers’ ability to anticipate all the ways sales incentive plans can be twisted for self-serving purposes—what management scholars Mark Seabright and Marshall Schminke call “immoral imagination.”

Incentive managers with limited immoral imagination should ask trusted sales leaders and professionals to look over drafts of incentive plans to identify ways in which people might game them. Reviewing the list of common tactics can spur everyone’s thinking to identify loopholes and opportunities for rule-breaking or outright cheating. Managers can use those insights to clarify rules, develop gaming safeguards, and design monitoring protocols.

Plan managers can also use the typology to detect cheating in existing plans. When incentive teams conduct audits of sales data, the typology can help them look for signs of wrongdoing or flaws in the plan design. Generally, this means examining data in the sales management systems for irregularities in salespeople’s behavior, deal closing, revenue measurement and recording, and the data flow and calculations that determine incentive payouts.

Consider how two companies we have worked with or advised used the typology to supplement their standard protocols to find misbehavior.

The incentive manager at a large U.S. financial institution noticed that the account-opening performance of one retail branch exceeded the performance of comparable branches in the region. Given this irregularity, the team suspected that a small group of bankers were using the faux-customer tactic. It initiated an audit of all deposit accounts opened in the previous 12 months and flagged those that had been closed in less than 90 days. The audit revealed that two bankers routinely opened fake customer accounts and then closed them after they had been recognized by the incentive system. The company terminated the bankers and expanded monitoring for this pattern of account activity.

And recall our call center example of lost-in-segmentation behavior. After a week of intensive monitoring, the incentive plan team determined that 15% of the reps were ignoring a large share of their incoming calls, forcing other team members to pick them up, so that these reps could focus on commission-paying outbound calls. Team leaders corrected the behavior with one-on-one discussions, and the incentive team instituted a process for flagging similar behavior in the future.

Some of these practices may seem to be victimless crimes or relatively insignificant. Submitting a customer order on the first day of the month rather than the last day of the previous month, for instance, might annoy the budget team but have minimal impact on financial performance. But misleading customers, submitting false data, or creating phony customers can jeopardize customer relationships, pose serious risks, and ultimately result in catastrophic financial consequences.

What steps should managers take to minimize gaming behaviors? Start by identifying which strategies your salespeople use and evaluate the degree of the ethical breach. To determine the extent of the problem, ask yourself whether it is the practice of many sales representatives, a few, or a single person. Then consider the ramifications of the type of cheating on customer relationships, financial performance, and legal, reputational, and other risks. (See the exhibit “How Bad Is Your Cheating Problem?”)

Salespeople who game the system may see their behavior as a harmless bending of the rules and may not be out to do real damage to the company or to customers. And it’s true that all sales-cheating methods are not equal. Even when the prevalence of a certain cheating tactic is high, the effect on company performance can be fairly insignificant and the behavior not indicative of a serious ethical problem. In other cases, the impact can be severe.

Consider the situation faced by security systems provider Vivint Smart Home. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in 2021 some 130 of the company’s commissioned sales reps regularly engaged in identity theft to approve customers for loans. If a customer didn’t qualify for a loan, the reps would illegally use the credit rec ord of an unrelated person with the same name. Falsifying data in this way—often called “white paging”—is a violation of several laws. The company admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay a $15 million civil fine and a $5 million fine to affected customers.

Given that a sizable number of sales reps had regularly engaged in the behavior, and given the significant reputational damage and legal fines incurred, we would place that gaming activity in the top-right “widespread disruptive” quadrant. Companies that find themselves in that quadrant should immediately alert leaders from sales, legal, and compliance functions and risk management. They should develop a remediation plan for affected customers, and in consultation with HR, they should aggressively address the problem, including possibly terminating the offending salespeople. The company should put stringent controls in place to ensure that the behavior does not persist.

Once a company has determined the extent of cheating schemes, leaders should carefully consider making changes to the sales incentive plan. They should weigh the expected consequences of the behavior against their organization’s appetite for risk. In most cases, executives will conclude that tolerating salespeople’s cheating is not an option and the compromised plan must be fixed.
