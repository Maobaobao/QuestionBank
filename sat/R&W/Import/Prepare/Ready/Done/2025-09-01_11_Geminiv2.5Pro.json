      "text": "The Sound Lounge, a dimly lit enclave tucked into downtown Minneapolis, exuded an air of curated intimacy as Evan and Drew sank into one of its listening booths. The bar offered patrons a rare indulgence: the chance to slip on a pair of luxury headphones and lose themselves in music. Fritch Audio had outfitted the venue with its finest gear when it first opened; in exchange, the founders got a VIP booth and liberal pours of whiskey whenever they visited."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "Evan glanced at Drew, who was lost in the song, eyes closed and a smile on his face. His friend and partner lived and breathed music, spending his spare time restoring vintage audio equipment and hunting for rare vinyl. Together, they had grown Fritch from a passion project into a $5 million venture, beloved by audiophiles around the world. Yet despite the impressive revenue, the profits were slim, and the company didn’t seem to be gaining any more traction."

      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "Both men jumped as the 230-pound frame of Phil Warner plonked down in the booth across from them, disrupting their musical reverie. “There they are!” Phil said loudly, his voice booming over the quiet hum of the bar. “The maestros themselves! I’ve been dying to meet with you guys.”"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "“Let me cut to the chase. I’ve done a lot of research on you guys and your competitors, and I’ve looked over the business plan, marketing docs, and financials that Drew forwarded. I like what I see. I’d like to make a $1 million investment in Fritch Audio. All I ask is that we set out a strategy together to grow Fritch to $15 million in revenue and double the margins. Well, that and a 15% stake in the company!”"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "His excitement building, he continued. “I think you guys could have the most powerful soundstage in the world,” he said, misusing a term he’d clearly picked up secondhand. Evan caught Drew’s eye again, and a subtle grin flickered between them."

      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "Phil paused mid-sentence, reading the room with a salesman’s instinct. He chuckled, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Alright, alright. I’ll stick to what I know. You keep making the magic; I’ll help turn this into a serious business.” Evan’s thoughts reeled, the offer triggering a now-familiar mix of pride and dread. “I’m honored, Phil. Truly. But the timing…I’ve just been offered a promotion at my day job.”"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "“I get it,” Phil said. “Stability, loyalty— that’s important. But I envision great things for Fritch. Opportunities like this don’t come around too often.” He paused to let the message land. “I guess it’s a question of whether you want to build a real company or just play at it.”"

        "A": "To analyze the business strategy of The Sound Lounge.",

        "D": "To argue for the benefits of listening to music on luxury headphones."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage sets the scene by describing The Sound Lounge and introducing Evan and Drew, the founders of Fritch Audio, establishing their relationship with the venue. The other options are too specific or not supported by the text.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For 'main purpose' questions, look for the option that captures the overall function of the passage. Avoid answers that focus on a single detail."

      "question": "As used in the text, what is the meaning of “enclave”?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A large, open concert hall.",
        "B": "A secluded or distinct place.",
        "C": "A popular commercial district.",
        "D": "A temporary musical installation."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage describes The Sound Lounge as a 'dimly lit' place 'tucked into downtown Minneapolis,' suggesting it is a distinct, somewhat hidden spot. 'Secluded or distinct place' best captures this contextual meaning.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When encountering an unfamiliar word, use surrounding descriptions ('dimly lit,' 'tucked into') to infer its meaning. Don't rely solely on a dictionary definition out of context."

        "A": "The company is on the verge of bankruptcy due to a lack of revenue.",
        "B": "The company is highly profitable but has a limited customer base.",
        "C": "The company has achieved significant revenue but struggles with profitability and growth.",
        "D": "The company's success is primarily due to its aggressive marketing strategies."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The text states that Fritch is a '$5 million venture' (impressive revenue) but that 'the profits were slim' and it 'didn’t seem to be gaining any more traction' (struggles with profitability and growth). This directly supports option C.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For inference questions, piece together multiple details from the text. The answer is often a synthesis of several pieces of information rather than a single stated fact."

        "A": "heated argument.",
        "B": "business meeting.",
        "C": "peaceful daydream.",
        "D": "loud celebration."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Evan and Drew were 'lost in the song' in a 'dimly lit enclave' before being 'disrupted.' This context suggests they were in a state of deep, pleasant absorption, which aligns with the meaning of 'reverie' as a peaceful daydream.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Pay close attention to the mood and tone of the passage. The contrast between the 'quiet hum' and Phil's 'booming' voice helps define the state that was interrupted."

        "D": "company! Evan laughed awkwardly, as Drew"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The original sentence fragment ends Phil's dialogue. A closing quotation mark is needed after 'company' to signal the end of his speech. A period is appropriate to end his exclamatory statement before starting the new sentence describing Evan's reaction.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Always check for correct punctuation around dialogue. A tag like 'he said' or a description of a character's action following dialogue must be punctuated correctly relative to the closing quotation mark."

        "D": "create suspense about whether Phil's investment offer is genuine."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Phil's misuse of a technical term, combined with Evan and Drew's subtle exchange, highlights a key dynamic: Phil has business acumen and capital, but Evan and Drew are the technical and passionate experts. It shows his strengths (business) and weaknesses (industry specifics) without suggesting malice.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For questions about authorial choice, consider the effect of a detail on characterization and theme. Ask yourself: 'What does this specific detail reveal about the characters or their situation?'"

      "question": "While researching the central conflict of the narrative, a student takes the following notes:<br><br>- Evan has a stable day job.<br>- He was just offered a promotion.<br>- Phil's offer represents a significant opportunity for Fritch Audio.<br>- Accepting the offer requires Evan to leave his job.<br>- This creates a conflict between security and passion.<br><br>The student wants to summarize Evan's dilemma. Which choice most effectively uses information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Evan's dilemma is that he must choose between his stable day job, where he was just offered a promotion, and the significant opportunity for Fritch Audio.",
        "B": "Faced with an investment offer from Phil that could transform his passion project, Evan must weigh this entrepreneurial opportunity against the security of his traditional career, which has just offered him a promotion.",
        "C": "Evan has two choices: taking a promotion at his day job or accepting Phil's offer, which creates conflict.",
        "D": "Phil's offer for Fritch Audio is a great opportunity, but Evan's conflict is about his day job and the promotion he was just offered there."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This choice is the most effective because it synthesizes all the key notes into a single, rhetorically effective sentence. It frames the conflict ('weigh this entrepreneurial opportunity against the security of his traditional career') and includes all the essential details (Phil's offer, passion project, promotion) in a sophisticated structure.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "In Rhetorical Synthesis questions, the best answer doesn't just list the notes; it weaves them together to create a new, coherent statement that fulfills a specific rhetorical purpose (e.g., to summarize, to emphasize, to contrast)."

        "D": "“I’ve just been offered a promotion at my day job.”"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This option is the strongest evidence because it explicitly names the conflicting emotions Evan feels: 'pride' in his creation and the offer, and 'dread' about the difficult choice it forces. It directly describes his internal state, which is the core of the conflict.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When a question asks for evidence of an internal state (like conflict, excitement, or doubt), look for the quotation that most directly describes feelings or thoughts, rather than just dialogue or actions."

        "A": "accuse Evan and Drew of being unprofessional and lazy.",

        "D": "summarize the financial terms of his proposed investment."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This statement is a classic sales/negotiation tactic. Phil isn't literally accusing them; he's creating a powerful rhetorical frame. He contrasts 'a real company' (implying growth, seriousness, and accepting his offer) with 'playing at it' (implying their current state is unserious). This is designed to challenge Evan's pride and force him to see the decision in stark, ambitious terms.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For advanced inference questions, analyze the subtext and rhetorical strategy of dialogue. Ask not just what the words mean literally, but what the speaker is *doing* with those words—are they persuading, challenging, threatening, or something else?"

      "question": "The writer is considering deleting the underlined sentence. Should the writer make this deletion?<br><br>'His friend and partner lived and breathed music, spending his spare time restoring vintage audio equipment and hunting for rare vinyl. <u>Together, they had grown Fritch from a passion project into a $5 million venture, beloved by audiophiles around the world.</u> Yet despite the impressive revenue, the profits were slim, and the company didn’t seem to be gaining any more traction.'",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, because it interrupts the description of Drew's personal hobbies with irrelevant business information.",
        "B": "Yes, because it makes the subsequent sentence about slim profits and lack of traction seem contradictory.",
        "C": "No, because it provides essential context about the company's scale, which is necessary to understand the significance of its financial struggles.",
        "D": "No, because it explains how Drew's passion for music directly translated into the company's financial success."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The underlined sentence is crucial. It establishes that Fritch Audio is already a successful, multi-million dollar venture. Without this information, the following sentence about 'slim profits' and 'no traction' would lack impact. The contrast between the impressive revenue ('$5 million venture') and the underlying problems ('slim profits') is the central tension of the company's situation, which Phil's offer aims to solve.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When asked whether to delete a sentence, evaluate its function. Does it provide essential context, support a claim, or act as a transition? If removing it makes the surrounding text confusing or less impactful, it should be kept."
