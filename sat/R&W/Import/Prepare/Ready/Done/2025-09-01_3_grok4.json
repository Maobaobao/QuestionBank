      "text": "Clearly the companies that are best at continually increasing their triple-product return will have the greatest chance of competitive success. But getting there is hard. It involves meeting digital transformation requirements, aligning teams around a new course of action, helping people across the company change their behavior to maximize the benefits of working with AI, and reallocating budgets. So how should companies proceed?<br><br>Let’s start with the assumption that organizations should be far along on the digital transformation journey, especially with the digitization of data, the adoption of cloud computing, and the establishment of security and governance protocols. Digital transformation can be a long process; expecting to complete it before trying to realize any benefits from AI is unrealistic. It’s best to begin with a small number of business processes, maybe even just one, in which AI can be easily deployed and where it has already proved valuable for other companies. Coding, customer service, marketing, and general productivity tasks are a few prime examples. Those processes usually have digitized data and software-centric workflows that make achieving AI-based improvements easier."

      "text": "AI safety and governance are foundational to success as well. Given the risks of bias, misinformation, deep fakes, and cyberattacks, companies have to establish clear guidelines and principles to safeguard their AI efforts. Again, these are hard to create in the abstract and much easier when a specific business process is the focus. Trust and safety should be among the top priorities for any organization exploring artificial intelligence.<br><br>As with any transformation, persuading people and achieving organizational change can be even more challenging than technical implementation. In addition to the triedand- true principles of change management, an effective way to drive change in this case is to cultivate a group of employees who are early adopters of AI in select processes and empower them to become AI champions within the organization. They can serve as role models and peer mentors, accelerating adoption at every level of the company. However, the imperative that all employees learn AI cannot be overstated. Moderna’s success in rapidly deploying gen AI across its enterprise was enabled by the creation of an “AI academy”—a mandatory internal course that included 20 hours of training on AI and its business impact. Research shows that AI can fail at the front lines, and employee training is an important way to avoid that outcome."

      "text": "Finally, a budget should be allocated for even early activities. As companies realize a greater triple-product return, the cost of using AI will be more than offset by productivity gains. Organizations will begin to regard AI as a core element in the budgets of all divisions, be they lines of business, functions, or the corporate center.<br><br>Coursera provides a great example of a company that started with a specific process—in this case coding—and now innovates rapidly and broadly with AI across a range of activities. When ChatGPT was introduced, Coursera’s CEO, Jeff Maggioncalda, quickly recognized the potential of gen AI and started bringing it into his company. He believed that Coursera’s software engineers needed to better understand emerging gen AI capabilities to truly create value. His company hired a firm that specialized in gen AI coding techniques to conduct training for its software developers. It also introduced an AI assistant that helped its engineers code more efficiently. Equipped with knowledge and tools, the teams at Coursera were able within just a year to incorporate AI capabilities into several products, such as translation, personalized learning, and automated course creation. By learning and doing, Coursera’s employees have positioned themselves to continue innovating and to stay ahead of the competition as new AI capabilities become available."

      "text": "If companies derive value from providing a differentiated bundle of expertise, how can they continue to be relevant when improvements in AI’s core capabilities make some or all of that expertise more easily available to competitors and customers? What is the basis for value capture in an era of abundant expertise?<br><br>We believe that every company will need to reevaluate its strategy in this changing era and will have to ask itself three questions.<br><br>Which aspects of the problem we now solve for customers will customers use AI to solve themselves? Consider the work of travel agents. For many years customers have been able to find information about travel destinations and book reservations online. Now they can simply consult AI apps to create tailored travel itineraries based on their unique preferences. As AI’s ability to take action improves, it will be able to make reservations as well. Travel agents will need to reinvent themselves—perhaps by organizing unique events and experiences for their clients."

      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Which types of expertise that we currently possess will need to evolve most if we are to remain ahead of AI’s capabilities? Companies must continue to develop their unique expertise to provide value beyond what AI provides. For example, in the medical field AI can in some cases perform image-based diagnoses more accurately than physicians can. As doctors’ offices enter this new age, they will need to acquire nontechnical capabilities, such as empathy, caregiving, and working collaboratively with a team of healthcare professionals to design the right course of treatment for a patient.<br><br>Which assets can we build or augment to enhance our ability to stay competitive as AI advances? As AI comes to offer a broader range of expertise, companies will need to look to other sources of durable advantage. AI is currently unlikely to affect brands, customer relationships, ownership of scarce physical assets, and network effects. For example, a consumer-product designer can now use AI to create prototype designs to meet certain specifications. The designs are informed by the quality and nuance of the specifications, which will have been shaped by in-depth and insightfully designed customer research. The ability to gather that research may eventually become more differentiating than the raw ability to create designs. A deep and trusted relationship with customers could be the best way to underpin and sustain that capability."

      "text": "Without question, companies will continue to use bundles of differentiated expertise and other hard-to-replicate assets to create and capture value. But the expertise and assets that proved valuable in the past will need to be reexamined as AI improves. Over time the organizations that fully exploit AI to rapidly adapt their operations and strategy are the ones that will thrive."
