### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of Essay (markdown format), **"How Fast Should Your Company Really Grow?" by Murat Tarakci. (Harvard Business Review USA, March-April, 2024)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Here is the article:
"

While sustained profitable growth is a nearly universal goal, it is an elusive one for many companies. Empirical research that I and others have conducted on the long-term patterns of growth in U.S. corporations suggests that when inflation is taken into account, most companies barely grow. For instance, in an analysis of 10,897 publicly held U.S. companies from 1976 to 2019, my research associate Catherine Piner and I found that firms in the top quartile grew at an inflation-adjusted average of 11.8% per year, but those in the lower three quartiles experienced little or no growth (0.3%, 0.03%, and -0.5%, respectively). And the majority of firms in the top quartile were unable to sustain superior growth performance for more than a few years. Although challenging to achieve, sustained profitable growth is not impossible, however. In our analysis, we found that only about 15% of the companies in the top growth quartile in 1985 were able to sustain their top-quartile performance for at least 30 years.

Over the past two decades, I have tried to understand why some companies are more effective at sustaining growth and what senior leaders can do to navigate the organizational challenges it poses. In addition to quantitative statistical analysis of large samples of U.S. companies over multiple decades, I have conducted case studies of more than 20 companies in a variety of industries, including semiconductors, software, health care, life sciences, restaurants, airlines, alcoholic beverages, luxury goods, apparel, hotels, and automobiles. I’ve also gleaned additional insights from my experience consulting for (and serving on the boards of) companies ranging in size from start-ups to some of the world’s largest corporations.

I have found that while the usual explanations for slow or minimal growth—market forces and technological changes such as disruptive innovation— play a role, many companies’ growth problems are self-inflicted. Specifically, firms approach growth in a highly reactive, opportunistic manner. When market demand is booming, they go on hiring binges, throw resources at developing new capacity, and build out organizational infrastructure without thinking through the implications—for example, whether their operating systems and processes can scale, how rapid growth might affect corporate culture, whether they can attract the human capital necessary to deliver that growth, and what would happen if demand slows. In the process of chasing growth, companies can easily destroy the things that made them successful in the first place, such as their capacity for innovation, their agility, their great customer service, or their unique cultures. When demand slows, pressures to maintain historical growth rates can lead to quick-fix solutions such as costly acquisitions or drastic cuts in R&D, other capabilities, and training. The damage caused by these moves only exacerbates the growth problems.

Sustaining profitable growth requires a delicate balance between the pursuit of market opportunities (demand) and the creation of the capabilities and capacity needed to exploit those opportunities (supply). To proactively manage that balance, companies need a growth strategy that explicitly addresses three interrelated decisions: how fast to grow (the target rate of growth); where to seek new sources of demand (the direction of growth); and how to amass the financial, human, and organizational resources needed to grow (the method of growth).

Each of those decisions involves trade-offs that must be considered in concert with a company’s overall business strategy, its capabilities and culture, and external market dynamics. (See the sidebar “The Perils of an Unintegrated Growth Strategy.”) My ratedirection - method (RDM) framework highlights the critical interdependencies between decisions that are all too often made separately. Using the framework to illuminate the tradeoffs, companies can create a balanced growth strategy.

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
- In the questions, answers, explanations and score improvement tip, **don't show the passage number**.
