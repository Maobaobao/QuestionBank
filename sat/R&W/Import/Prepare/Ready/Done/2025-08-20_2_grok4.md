### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of FICTION (markdown format), **"Five Bridges" by Colm Tóibín. (The New Yorker, March 10, 2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Here is the article:
"

Sunday was his busy day. Although he called himself a plumber, he had never actually got a license and lacked the finer knowledge of the trade. He could, however, fix a leak; he could replace a washer; he could use a soldering iron; he could deal with most types of valves; and he could put in new taps. He had his own way of unblocking pipes. Anything more complicated he left to others. Since he had stopped
drinking, he could set out immediately if there was an emergency. He didn’t need to advertise; people he’d worked for passed on his number to others. He could be depended on to respond to a call from anywhere in the Bay Area.

He went into his tiny bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. He should get a haircut before he went home, or even before he went on a hike. And get his eyebrows tidied up. And he should try to shave more often. Almost no one had been in this apartment since he had split up with Nuala Breathnach, who used to sing on Thursday nights at the Greyhound Track, the bar in Oakland that he frequented. At first, Nuala had actually claimed to like this cramped, cluttered space with windows that rattled when
buses and trucks went by.

In the end, she told him, and then anyone else in the bar who would listen, that the reason she was returning to Mayo was the state of Paul’s apartment—the awful sheets, the flat pillows, the pile of clothes on the old armchair, the smell of stale beer.

“That sort of thing is over,” she said. “There isn’t one fellow at home who’s still living like that.”

Soon he would not be living like that, either. He would have to begin clearing out the apartment, put most of what he had in bags and take them somewhere. He liked the idea of travelling back with hardly any luggage, just the cash he had saved hidden in pockets and in socks. He should leave some cash with Sandra to give to Geraldine in the future, but he worried that she might ask him if he was just using his daughter as a way of keeping his money safe.

“Hike bookd for Stday 18th” came from Sandra two days later. And then a text from Geraldine to say that he could collect her at nine, and they would meet Sandra and Stan in the parking lot.

All he needed now, he thought, was a text from Stan to say how much he was looking forward to meeting him. 

They had to have realized, even if he had not spelled it out, that, having been in the United States for more than thirty years on a simple tourist visa, once he left he would not be allowed to return,
probably not ever. He had made sure to have his passport renewed, but it was his Irish passport. He had asked a few friends if it would make a difference that he had a daughter in America, but everyone thought not.
