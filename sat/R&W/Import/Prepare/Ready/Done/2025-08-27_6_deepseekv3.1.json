      "text": "Hajdu seems to be curious and optimistic about this line of inquiry. “Machines of many kinds have been communicating things for ages, playing invaluable roles in our communication through art,” he says. “Growing in intelligence, machines may still have more to communicate, if we let them.” But the question that The Uncanny Muse raises at the end is: Why should we art-making humans be so quick to hand over the paint to the paintbrush? Why do we care how the paintbrush sees the world? Are we truly finished telling our own stories ourselves?"

      "text": "Pria Anand might say no. In The Mind Electric, she writes: “Narrative is universally, spectacularly human; it is as unconscious as breathing, as essential as sleep, as comforting as familiarity. It has the capacity to bind us, but also to other, to lay bare, but also obscure.” The electricity in The Mind Electric belongs entirely to the human brain-no metaphor necessary. Instead, the book explores a number of neurological afflictions and the stories patients and doctors tell to better understand them. “The truth of our bodies and minds is as strange as fiction,” Anand writes-and the language she uses throughout the book is as evocative as that in any novel."

    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "In personal and deeply researched vignettes in the tradition of Oliver Sacks, Anand shows that any comparison between brains and machines will inevitably fall flat. She tells of patients who see clear images when they’re functionally blind, invent entire backstories when they’ve lost a memory, break along seams that few can find, and-yes-see and hear ghosts. In fact, Anand cites one study of 375 college students in which researchers found that nearly three-quarters “had heard a voice that no one else could hear.” These were not diagnosed schizophrenics or sufferers of brain tumors-just people listening to their own uncanny muses."

    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Many heard their name, others heard God, and some could make out the voice of a loved one who’d passed on. Anand suggests that writers throughout history have harnessed organic exchanges with these internal apparitions to make art. “I see myself taking the breath of these voices in my sails,” Virginia Woolf wrote of her own experiences with ghostly sounds. “I am a porous vessel afloat on sensation.” The mind in The Mind Electric is vast, mysterious, and populated. The narratives people construct to traverse it are just as full of wonder."

    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Humans are not going to stop using technology to help us create anytime soon-and there’s no reason we should. Machines make for wonderful tools, as they always have. But when we turn the tools themselves into artists and storytellers, brains and bodies, magicians and ghosts, we bypass truth for wish fulfillment. Maybe what’s worse, we rob ourselves of the opportunity to contribute our own voices to the lively and loud chorus of human experience. And we keep others from the human pleasure of hearing them too."

      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The phrase is a metaphor. The 'paintbrush' represents the AI tool. 'Handing over the paint' means giving the AI the primary creative agency, which is the central concern of the passage.",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The passage states that using AI as the artist 'rob[s] ourselves of the opportunity to contribute our own voices' and denies others the 'human pleasure of hearing them.' This emphasizes the value of authentic human expression and connection.",

      "explanation": "The passage begins by stating 'Pria Anand might say no' in response to the question from passage one about handing over creation to machines. It then elaborates on Anand's view that narrative is 'spectacularly human,' establishing her work as a contrasting perspective to Hajdu's more optimistic view on AI.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Pay close attention to transitional phrases at the beginning of paragraphs (e.g., 'might say no'). They often signal how the new paragraph connects to or contrasts with the previous one."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The author does not outright dismiss AI art but uses rhetorical questions to probe the underlying reasons for pursuing it ('Why should we...?', 'Why do we care...?', 'Are we truly finished...?'). This implies a skepticism that calls for deeper examination of our motivations, not a simple rejection. The tone is questioning and critical, not dismissive.",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The sentence immediately before the quote states that Anand suggests writers 'have harnessed organic exchanges with these internal apparitions to make art.' The Woolf quote is then introduced as a specific, firsthand example of this phenomenon, illustrating how an artist described her interaction with these internal 'voices.'",

      "explanation": "The passage explicitly approves of technology as 'wonderful tools.' Its main purpose is to draw a line at the point where tools become seen as artists themselves, arguing that this shift causes us to 'bypass truth for wish fulfillment' and lose the authentic human connection inherent in art. It is a warning against this specific conflation.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "To identify the main purpose, look for the author's argumentative thesis, often found in the second half of a paragraph. Distinguish between what the author accepts (using tools) and what they are arguing against (treating tools as artists)."

      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The author's overall argument is that human cognition and creativity are profound, mysterious, and fundamentally different from machine operation. The vignettes about patients (and later the study on healthy students) are used to build this case by showcasing the bizarre, non-mechanical, and awe-inspiring capabilities—and malfunctions—of the human brain, which contrasts with the predictable nature of AI.",

The 'wish' is for technology to effortlessly replace the complex, often difficult, human creative process.",
