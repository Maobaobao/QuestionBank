Artificial intelligence was barely a term in 1956, when top scien- tists from the field of computing arrived at Dartmouth College for a summer conference. The computer scientist John McCarthy had coined the phrase in the funding proposal for the event, a gathering to work through how to build machines that could use language, solve problems like humans, and improve them- selves. But it was a good choice, one that captured the organiz- ers’ founding premise: Any feature of human intelligence could “in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”

In their proposal, the group had listed several “aspects of the artificial intelligence problem.” The last item on their list, and in hindsight perhaps the most difficult, was building a machine that could exhibit creativity and originality.

At the time, psychologists were grappling with how to define and measure creativity in humans. The prevailing theory-that creativity was a product of intelligence and high IQ-was fading, but psychologists weren’t sure what to replace it with. The Dartmouth organizers had one of their own. “The difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of some randomness,” they wrote, adding that such randomness “must be guided by intuition to be efficient.” Nearly 70 years later, following a number of boom-and-bust cycles in the field, we now have AI models that more or less follow that recipe. While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains. By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people, as well as bizarre, surreal results that feel distinctly nonhuman.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. AI-generated creative works-from orchestra performances to heavy metal-are poised to suffuse our lives more thoroughly than any other product of AI has done yet. The songs are likely to blend into our streaming platforms, party and wedding playlists, soundtracks, and more, whether or not we notice who (or what) made them.

For years, diffusion models have stirred debate in the visual-art world about whether what they produce reflects true creation or mere replication. Now this debate has come for music, an art form that is deeply embedded in our experiences, memories, and social lives. Music models can now create songs capable of eliciting real emotional responses, presenting a stark example of how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI.

The courts are actively grappling with this murky territory. Major record labels are suing the top AI music generators, alleging that diffusion models do little more than replicate human art without compensation to artists. The model makers counter that their tools are made to assist in human creation. In deciding who is right, we’re forced to think hard about our own human creativity. Is creativity, whether in artificial neural networks or biological ones, merely the result of vast statistical learning and drawn connections, with a sprinkling of randomness? If so, then authorship is a slippery concept. If not-if there is some distinctly human element to creativity-what is it? What does it mean to be moved by something without a human creator? I had to wrestle with these questions the first time I heard an AI-generated song that was genuinely fantastic-it was unsettling to know that someone merely wrote a prompt and clicked “Generate.” That predicament is coming soon for you, too.

After the Dartmouth conference, its participants went off in different research directions to create the foundational technologies of AI. At the same time, cognitive scientists were fol- lowing a 1950 call from J.P. Guilford, president of the American Psychological Association, to tackle the question of creativity in human beings. They came to a definition, first formalized in 1953 by the psychologist Morris Stein in the Journal of Psychology: Creative works are both novel, meaning they present something new, and useful, meaning they serve some purpose to someone. Some have called for “useful” to be replaced by “satisfying,” and others have pushed for a third criterion: that creative things are also surprising.

Later, in the 1990s, the rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to study more of the neural mechanisms underlying creativity in many fields, including music. Computational methods in the past few years have also made it easier to map out the role that memory and associative thinking play in creative decisions.

What has emerged is less a grand unified theory of how a creative idea originates and unfolds in the brain and more an ever-growing list of powerful observations. We can first divide the human creative process into phases, including an ideation or proposal step, followed by a more critical and evaluative step that looks for merit in ideas. A leading theory on what guides these two phases is called the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the most creative people can form novel connections between distant concepts.

“It could be like spreading activation,” says Roger Beaty, a researcher who leads the Cognitive Neuroscience of Creativity Laboratory at Penn State. “You think of one thing; it just kind of activates related concepts to whatever that one concept is.”

These connections often hinge specifically on semantic memory, which stores concepts and facts, as opposed to episodic memory, which stores memories from a particular time and place. Recently, more sophisticated computational models have been used to study how people make connections between concepts across great “semantic distances.” For example, the word apocalypse is more closely related to nuclear power than to celebration. Studies have shown that highly creative people may perceive very semantically distinct concepts as close together. Artists have been found to generate word associations across greater distances than non-artists. Other research has supported the idea that creative people have “leaky” attention-that is, they often notice information that might not be particularly relevant to their immediate task.

Neuroscientific methods for evaluating these processes do not suggest that creativity unfolds in a particular area of the brain. “Nothing in the brain produces creativity like a gland secretes a hormone,” Dean Keith Simonton, a leader in creativity research, wrote in the Cambridge Handbook of the Neuroscience of Creativity.

The evidence instead points to a few dispersed networks of activity during creative thought, Beaty says-one to support the initial generation of ideas through associative thinking, another involved in identifying promising ideas, and another for evaluation and modification. A new study, led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and published in February, suggests that creativity might even involve the suppression of particular brain networks, like ones involved in self-censorship. So far, machine creativity if you can call it that-looks quite different. Though at the time of the Dartmouth conference AI researchers were interested in machines inspired by human brains, that focus had shifted by the time diffusion models were invented, about a decade ago.

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
