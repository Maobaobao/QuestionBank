      "text": "Teams of individuals from various cultures must negotiate in the face of differing expectations about not only the outcome but also the process. The parties may lack both a common language and shared working norms, complicating an already complex endeavor.<br><br>In bridging these gaps, negotiators are often left to fend for themselves, relying on anecdotal or conventional wisdom that has little bearing on the negotiation at hand. Or they may turn to academic or other theories that seem to explain cultural differences but generalize about cultures as a whole, ignoring individual variances. All this may encourage dealmakers to overascribe negotiation difficulties to cultural differences."

      "text": "In one contract negotiation we studied, a German negotiator attributed problems with his Chinese counterpart and the deal’s stalled progress to his lack of understanding of Chinese culture. The Chinese negotiator repeatedly rejected terms offered by the German, even when they aligned with international standards. Instead, he pushed for terms that he claimed met local Chinese standards. When asked for evidence, the Chinese negotiator seemed offended and said that the German negotiator should trust his word. Later in the negotiation, after they had agreed on several points, the Chinese negotiator kept reopening issues while presenting no legitimate reasons for doing so. He consistently pushed to improve the terms of the deal to his advantage and rejected counterbalancing suggestions, slowly but surely transferring more value away from the German negotiator. Whenever the German negotiator objected, his counterpart stated that this was necessary to build a long-term partnership the Chinese way. Only much later, after coaching by a negotiation expert, did the German negotiator realize that his counterpart had been using cultural differences as a smokescreen for questionable and adversarial behaviors."

      "text": "So how can negotiators successfully navigate the complexities of culture? We’ve been researching, teaching, and advising on cross-cultural negotiation and multicultural teamwork as well as conducting negotiations ourselves for a collective five decades. Through this work, we’ve come to realize that the secret to good outcomes in cross-cultural contexts involves respecting four basic rules: First, look past cultural differences and focus instead on individual players. Second, work out whether your counterpart is seeking to exploit a perceived advantage or is interested in generating value for both parties. Third, create shared norms for the negotiation (rather than adapting to the other party’s rituals). Finally, leverage the differences in preferences between parties to improve outcomes for everyone. Following these four rules will help you create a stable and lasting deal."

      "text": "Let’s begin by looking at why it’s best to focus on the person rather than the culture.<br><br>Culture can be defined as the operating system through which we make sense of and interact with the world. Culture influences our behaviors and perceptions as we go about our day-to-day business. A very strong culture can foster ethnocentrism—an assumption that one’s own norms are or should be shared by everyone. This is a recipe for conflict."

    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "There are many dimensions along which cultures can vary, such as tolerance for risk and how to handle conflict. Communication is another obvious one. Israelis, for instance, are generally direct and straightforward in communicating, whereas Mexicans tend to be indirect in giving feedback, especially on sensitive issues. Of course, individuals may hew to their cultures to a greater or lesser extent. Some Mexicans are very direct, and some Israelis are far from straightforward. In some contexts, the various dimensions can serve as a framework for interpreting and for setting behaviors. For example, INSEAD professor Erin Meyer advises that when adapting to a new culture, people should strive to behave according to the midpoint of the local range on a given cultural dimension.<br><br>But in a very specific context like a negotiation, knowledge of local culture is of limited value because your counterpart may not represent its norms."

      "text": "Imagine you are preparing to negotiate with an Angolan executive, and you have read widely about Angolan cultural norms in preparation. Unbeknownst to you, however, your counterpart was born in Angola of foreign parents, educated in a British school there, traveled to France to continue her studies, married an Indian partner, converted to Islam, worked in sales for a U.S. company and then in procurement for a Japanese corporation, and has been living in China for the past 11 years. This executive is unlikely to be prototypical of her national culture, and thus you should be careful when using your research to make assumptions about her behavior.<br><br>In a negotiation, you are trying to understand the individual in front of you. And in this context, a focus on cultural differences may encourage unconscious stereotyping—that is, narrowly classifying and attributing expected behaviors to others."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "This creates two risks: One is Negative perceptions. Stereotypes may foster perceptions of cultural superiority or inferiority, leading to a sense of entitlement or a lack of empathy toward the other party. That can feed a rationalization for conflict. The other one is Presumption of universality. Stereotyping disregards the individuality and diversity present within any culture, which may blind negotiators to opportunities for positive outcomes and learning from their counterparts.<br><br>Another reason to focus on the individual rather than the culture in a negotiation is the infeasibility of becoming an expert in the customs and norms of all the geographies in which one might do business.<br><br>We believe that one key to a successful cross-cultural negotiation is, to some extent, taking culture out of the equation. Business negotiators often have much in common with their counterparts—maybe even more than with their parents, partners, or children. After all, our international counterparts may be closer to us in age, education level, professional interests, the corporate world they operate in, or functional expertise. For these reasons we advise negotiators in cross-cultural settings to focus specifically on their counterparts, learning their own particular intentions, rituals, and preferences."

      "text": "For example, an executive responsible for the EMEA region may have morning negotiations with counterparts from Turkey and South Africa, followed by lunch with her boss who is expatriated from South Korea, then a meeting with executives from Ethiopia before closing a deal in the late afternoon with UAE nationals. The agenda for the next day might involve an entirely different set of nationalities. And even when you are dealing with a single foreign country, teams may include people from multiple backgrounds and cultures.<br><br>In such situations, it is nearly impossible to memorize and leverage all the cultural dimensions relevant for each interaction. What’s more, trying to be all things to all people only encourages your counterparts to question your integrity. You will constantly be outside your comfort zone, which makes you more vulnerable to ignorance, doubt, insecurity, and exploitation."

      "text": "A British negotiator from a London-based family office negotiating with a Japanese executive offers an instructive example. Instead of assuming that his counterpart would exhibit common Japanese cultural traits such as a preference for indirect communication, formality, or long investments in relationship building, the British negotiator observed how she actually behaved.<br><br>From the start, he saw that she was extremely friendly, shook his hand, greeted him in English with a slight American accent, and explained that she valued quick decision-making and innovation, having worked at a tech startup in Silicon Valley for many years prior to creating her own venture in Japan. She was candid, quick to share ideas, and clearly signaled her intention to collaborate. Noticing those traits, the British negotiator reciprocated with an equally open, collaborative style, which helped them establish a strong working rapport."
