### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of CRITICS (markdown format), **"Do liberals need to learn how to build?" by Benjamin Wallace-Wells. (The New Yorker, March 10, 2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Here is the article:
"

For some liberal journalists and researchers of my generation, the stagnation of American cities has become a fixation. The progressive metropolises we love the most, and where the highest-paying jobs are increasingly found, seem to be having the most trouble growing, perhaps because they have the most trouble building. In 2023, seventy thousand housing permits were issued in red-state metro Houston, and just forty thousand in metro New York, which has three times as many people. (In the San Francisco
and Boston metro areas, there were even fewer.) When urbanists looked into why that was, they tended to find not a single cause but a constellation. The idealistic progressive laws of the seventies—those mandating environmental review, safety and anti-corruption standards, historic preservation, prevailing wages, and, most important, local power over zoning—had meant to protect small communities against moneyed interests. But they had been manipulated by homeowners and businesses, and used to block
all kinds of new construction. Good intentions had paved the way to what the political scientist Francis Fukuyama termed a “vetocracy.” As the Times’ Ezra Klein and The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson
write of this regulatory pattern in their book “Abundance” (Avid Reader), “Each individual decision is rational. The collective consequences are maddening.”

Sometimes even the individual decisions are maddening. In San Francisco, anti-abortion activists stopped a clinic from being built by arguing that it would violate local standards for noise and
traffic—because of the protests they themselves intended to organize. Residents also managed to obtain historic-preservation status for a laundromat in an effort to prevent its demolition. (Twenty-seven per cent of Manhattan is shielded from developers because of various preservation covenants.) A Los Angeles project to convert a polluted aircraft factory into apartments and shops was sued twenty times in twenty years, under the same law. In Maryland, homeowners organized a petition to stall construction
on an apartment building in order to develop a parking lot.

Even public projects tend to get snarled in the same vetocracy. Adding a kilometre of subway track in the United States now costs twice what it does in Japan or Canada, and six times what it does in Portugal; in the past fifty years, the inflation-adjusted cost of a mile of interstate highway has tripled. A forthcoming academic paper detailing the long-arc history of urban development and its opponents, by the law professors Roderick M.Hills, Jr., of N.Y.U., and David Schleicher, of Yale, is titled “How the Gentry Won.”

These urbanists have been inching toward the political center, seeing the logic in development and turning against some progressive icons. In “Stuck” (Random House), by Yoni Appelbaum, of The Atlantic,
a chief villain is Jane Jacobs, the standard-bearer of Greenwich Village and a left-wing theorist of neighborhood living. But the need to build remained a niche obsession until the Biden Administration,
when some of the same intellectuals noticed that efforts to construct a green-energy infrastructure were foundering on the same opposition. Three years after Congress authorized $7.5 billion to create a nationwide E.V. charging network, only two hundred and fourteen individual chargers were ready. In the
mid-aughts, an entrepreneur named Michael Skelly conceived a plan to build a vast wind farm in the barren Oklahoma panhandle and sell the energy to the federal government’s Tennessee Valley Authority.
Skelly secured the Obama Administration’s commitment to buy his energy, but in the course of a decade the project slowly collapsed, as state powers dawdled and eventually refused to issue the necessary permits. Anyone who had been politically invested in the attempts to build high-rises in West Harlem would have noticed a familiar pattern. “We are at a moment of history,” Skelly is quoted as saying in “Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress—and How to Bring It Back” (Public Affairs), by Marc J. Dunkelman, a research fellow at Brown. “Robert Moses could come back from the dead and he wouldn’t be able to do shit.”

These three new books explore such decelerations, and seek to move from urbanism toward a more general political philosophy. Klein and Thompson are perhaps the most ambitious. “For decades, American liberalism has measured its success in how close it could come to the social welfare system of Denmark,” they write, but those efforts have been complicated by the difficulty of supplying enough
housing, enough solar panels, enough of what people need. They’re aiming for a “change in political culture” through which liberalism, which has long acted to pump the brakes on building things, now
works to “speed up the system.” Klein and Thompson want a “liberalism that builds,” not just in housing and green energy but in artificial intelligence and in drug development, too, areas where they see similar patterns of stagnation. Their goals are broad. This group of policies, which they call the abundance agenda, offers, Klein and Thompson believe, “a path out of the morass we’re in. A new political order.”
