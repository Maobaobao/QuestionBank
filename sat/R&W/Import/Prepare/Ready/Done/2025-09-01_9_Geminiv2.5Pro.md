### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of Essay (markdown format), **"The Secrets of Extraordinary Low-Cost Operators" by Thomas Hout (Harvard Business Review USA, March-April, 2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Here is the article:

Eliminate long-standing industry barriers to lower costs. Every industry has legacies and norms that add cost without adding value. Giants like Toyota and Southwest succeeded because they ignored standard industry practice. In the healthcare industry, mavericks such as Intermountain Healthcare and UPMC are doing the same. They’re taking similar approaches to developing protocols, are trying to move from fee-for-service to capitated care, and have created their own insurance companies.

And consider the auto insurance business, where litigation from policyholders is the single largest operating cost. Progressive devised a creative remedy: It introduced a mobile cadre of insurance adjusters who go directly to accident scenes, estimate the damage, and surprise the motorist with a check on the spot. Litigation expense and the cycle time of claims resolution both fell, helping make Progressive one of the few auto insurers that makes money on its core underwriting business, not just its financial portfolio. Progressive has even experimented with performing repair work on damaged vehicles to see what it could learn about how to reduce that cost and more precisely write insurance policies.

Ensure that product design and process design reinforce each other. The more each is developed with the other in mind, the lower the costs of complexity and the greater the potential for a smooth flow of operations. Think about how a good Chinese restaurant can offer a large menu of great dishes and get your food to the table quickly yet charge lower prices than a typical Western restaurant. It’s possible because the product and the process are designed to match perfectly. A Chinese menu is based on a common set of ingredients that are combined in many different ways and are almost all prepared in a wok. All steps are performed on a cellular work line: The raw ingredients are first chopped into just the right cooking size and then heated with a sauce in a wok. Most dishes have the same total processing time, and plates arrive at the table immediately after the food comes out of the wok. Using the same equipment and sequence of operations for all dishes minimizes down time, food waste, space, and investment in equipment. The Cheesecake Factory’s kitchen operation is designed along the same lines.

That’s in contrast to how most Western restaurants operate. Typically, each meal requires a combination of different ingredients and is prepared in semi-independent workstations— using sauté pans, ovens, fryers, blenders, kettles, and so on—with different processing times and labor intensity. The meals for a table of four will be ready at different times, and dishes that took less preparation time sit under a heat lamp. Food waste, equipment overhead, and table turnover time are all higher.

Quadrant Homes, a regional home builder in the Pacific Northwest and a subsidiary of Tri Pointe Homes, has some of the lowest prices and costs in the industry. It operates much like a Chinese restaurant. Scheduling at each stage in its value chain—from the number of daily prospective customer appointments at the showroom to the number of new homes started per day to the work done each day on each house—is “time-definite” (all scheduled tasks must be finished that day even if more-expensive overtime is required) and coordinated to synchronize the serial throughput at each consecutive stage, avoiding idle capacity at any one stage in the system. At the start of the process, new customers configure their desired home on a game-like console from a large set of pre-engineered modular options. The specs are then frozen, which enables upstream suppliers to produce to order, and the house is entered into the Quadrant backlog. In practice, that means that Quadrant can select a mix of difficult- and easy-to-build house projects to balance out the daily demands on its fixed workforce. Materials waste, time with an idle workforce, and time to completion are all low, and each home finishes on schedule. Over the years, the company has added new home types to expand its market but has adhered to the same basic operating model.

Develop original multipurpose technologies that connect the company to the customer and reduce cost. Low-cost companies’ desire to be different shows up in multipurpose innovations. For example, Quadrant Homes’ house configurator flags any features or dimensions of the desired house that have been chosen by the customer but don’t physically fit together. It also prices out the customer’s selected house. Finally, it records all the building materials to be ordered from suppliers. The company allows customers multiple visits so that they can change their minds about options, but then it freezes the specs; no changes are allowed after building has started, which would most likely be costly to the builder.

7-Eleven Japan combined its superior ability to capture customer data with AI-driven decision-making in order to know what and when during the day different customer groups buy fresh food. It uses this information to order from suppliers in real time three times a day, making adjustments on the basis of the weather forecast or special events in the area. Customers know they will find what they want on the shelf, and unsold items are minimized. Suppliers deliver in vans with customized company-designed interiors. Inside the store, shelves outfitted with digital sensors monitor where customers linger, triggering the display of more information about the product. The company is now experimenting with using AI for unmanned stores and robotic delivery.

Use cycle time and variance as a management tool. Together, cycle time and variance are the best metrics of the operating cost and quality of systems. Think of the basic physics of operations this way: Cycle time is minutes elapsed per finished unit of any process. Throughput is the number of units per minute—the inverse of cycle time— and determines capacity of the process. Low variance reflects consistently good outcomes, step by step, along the way, which results in high yields and enables shorter workcompletion cycles: It means there has been little or no wait time and rework, and few (or no) adverse surprises. Shorter cycles combined with low variance produce low cost per unit, because shorter cycles use less staff and less facility time and raise throughput capacity.

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
- In the questions, answers, explanations and score improvement tip, **don't show the passage number**.
