Clearly the companies that are best at continually increasing their triple-product return will have the greatest chance of competitive success. But getting there is hard. It involves meeting digital transformation requirements, aligning teams around a new course of action, helping people across the company change their behavior to maximize the benefits of working with AI, and reallocating budgets. So how should companies proceed?

Let’s start with the assumption that organizations should be far along on the digital transformation journey, especially with the digitization of data, the adoption of cloud computing, and the establishment of security and governance protocols. Digital transformation can be a long process; expecting to complete it before trying to realize any benefits from AI is unrealistic. It’s best to begin with a small number of business processes, maybe even just one, in which AI can be easily deployed and where it has already proved valuable for other companies. Coding, customer service, marketing, and general productivity tasks are a few prime examples. Those processes usually have digitized data and software-centric workflows that make achieving AI-based improvements easier.

AI safety and governance are foundational to success as well. Given the risks of bias, misinformation, deep fakes, and cyberattacks, companies have to establish clear guidelines and principles to safeguard their AI efforts. Again, these are hard to create in the abstract and much easier when a specific business process is the focus. Trust and safety should be among the top priorities for any organization exploring artificial intelligence.

As with any transformation, persuading people and achieving organizational change can be even more challenging than technical implementation. In addition to the triedand- true principles of change management, an effective way to drive change in this case is to cultivate a group of employees who are early adopters of AI in select processes and empower them to become AI champions within the organization. They can serve as role models and peer mentors, accelerating adoption at every level of the company.

However, the imperative that all employees learn AI cannot be overstated. Moderna’s success in rapidly deploying gen AI across its enterprise was enabled by the creation of an “AI academy”—a mandatory internal course that included 20 hours of training on AI and its business impact. Research shows that AI can fail at the front lines, and employee training is an important way to avoid that outcome.

Finally, a budget should be allocated for even early activities. As companies realize a greater triple-product return, the cost of using AI will be more than offset by productivity gains. Organizations will begin to regard AI as a core element in the budgets of all divisions, be they lines of business, functions, or the corporate center.

Coursera provides a great example of a company that started with a specific process—in this case coding—and now innovates rapidly and broadly with AI across a range of activities. When ChatGPT was introduced, Coursera’s CEO, Jeff Maggioncalda, quickly recognized the potential of gen AI and started bringing it into his company. He believed that Coursera’s software engineers needed to better understand emerging gen AI capabilities to truly create value. His company hired a firm that specialized in gen AI coding techniques to conduct training for its software developers. It also introduced an AI assistant that helped its engineers code more efficiently. Equipped with knowledge and tools, the teams at Coursera were able within just a year to incorporate AI capabilities into several products, such as translation, personalized learning, and automated course creation. By learning and doing, Coursera’s employees have positioned themselves to continue innovating and to stay ahead of the competition as new AI capabilities become available.

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
- In the questions, answers, explanations and score improvement tip, **don't show the passage number**.
