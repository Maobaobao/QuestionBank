    {
      "passage_number": 1,
      "text": "Ample research has shown that even small changes in wording can affect how a message is received. For example, service agents who use “I” rather than “we” see boosts in customer satisfaction; online reviews that include swear words are viewed as more helpful; and refusals couched as “I don’t” rather than “I can’t” are more persuasive. A new study finds that when it comes to conveying empathy, it’s not just what people say that counts but also how they say it—specifically, the rate at which they speak. And that can have powerful effects on the recipient’s perceptions and satisfaction."

    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "The researchers began with a field study in which they analyzed nearly 200 customer-service calls to a large U.S. online retailer. Automated tools measured each representative’s articulation rate, or the number of syllables uttered per second of speaking time, and customers graded the reps on helpfulness. The more slowly that reps spoke (within a normal range), the happier customers were with the help they received."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "To explore what drove those results, the researchers conducted three experiments. In the first, participants were asked to imagine calling customer service with a billing issue. They listened to one of two versions of the supposed agent’s response, recorded by a voice actor. In one version, the agent spoke one standard deviation more slowly than the average speed of the agents in the field study. In the other, the agent spoke one standard deviation more quickly. The participants then answered questions about the agent’s empathy and helpfulness and their satisfaction with the call. Those listening to the slower agent perceived greater degrees of empathy and helpfulness and reported higher satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "The second experiment was similar in design but compared slow and average speaking speeds and used a different context: Participants imagined that they were listening to a doctor’s response to a persistent and distressing medical complaint. Here, too, slower speech increased perceptions of empathy and raised satisfaction; it also made the doctor seem more proficient."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "The third experiment tested whether speed matters when people have less need for empathy: When participants were told that the medical issue was mild and would be easy to solve, the benefits of slow speech were less pronounced. Another analysis found that the gains were also lessened when speakers used inherently empathetic language."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "“Speaking more slowly signals that communicators understand and care about their audience’s needs,” the researchers write. “Frontline employees seek to build loyalty, politicians want to be trusted, and educators strive to foster growth. Our results suggest that a relatively simple shift…can help.”"
