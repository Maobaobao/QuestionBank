### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Here is the article:
"

Been a long while now coming up\
Thought we were past it, thought we’d patched it up\
Thought the title had passed hands\
Thought we’d had enough

But the Sun’s gonna go ahead and tag right up\
and we dont understand what we’re standing on\
and we sure come in blind\
With our timing

So I’ve culled what I can’t tame\
I have taken all that I can take\
It got bad enough\
I thought that I would leave . . .

I wish you could take that right off!\
All that shit that rips you right up\
Then you’d know that we been taught all this from Day One . . .\
from Day One

Same old town and yer\
parsing through\
Signs of live and die for you\
There’s a million ways\
You’re falling thru\
The cost of your mind

And some may say that\
you lack the stuff\
and you burn it down and\
clack your cuffs\
But you may have to toughen up\
While unlearning that lie
