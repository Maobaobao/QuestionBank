      "text": "The inspiration for the Armatron came from a newspaper clipping that Watanabe’s boss brought to him one day. “It showed an image of a ¢mechanical arm£ holding an egg with three fingers. I think we started out thinking, ‘This is where things are heading these days, so let’s make this,’” he recalled."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "As the lead of a small team, Watanabe briefly turned his attention to another project, and by the time he returned to the robotic arm, the team had a prototype. But it was quite different from the Armatron’s final form. “The hand stuck out from the main body to the side and could only move about 90 degrees. The control panel also had six movement positions, and they were switched using six switches. I personally didn’t like that,” said Watanabe. So he went back to work."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "Watanabe’s breakthrough was inspired by the radio­controlled helicopters he operated as a hobby. Holding up a radio remote controller with dual joystick controls, he told me, “This stick operation allows you to perform four movements with two arms, but I thought that if you twist this part, you can use six movements.” “I had always wanted to cre­ ate a system that could rotate 360 degrees, so I thought about how to make that system work,” he added."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Watanabe stressed that while he is listed as the Armatron’s primary inventor, it was a team effort. A designer created the case, colors, and logo, adding touches to mimic features seen on industrial robots of the time, such as the rubber tubes (which are just for looks)."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "When the Armatron first came out, in 1981, robotics engineers started contacting Watanabe. “I wasn’t so much hearing from people at toy stores, but rather from researchers at university laboratories, factories, and companies that were making industrial robots,” he said. “They were quite encouraging, and we often talked together.”"

      "text": "When the Armatron first came out, in 1981, robotics engineers started contacting Watanabe. “I wasn’t so much hearing from people at toy stores, but rather from researchers at university laboratories, factories, and companies that were making industrial robots,” he said. “They were quite encouraging, and we often talked together.”<br><br>The bold look and function of Armatron made quite an impression on many young kids who would one day have a career in robotics. One of them was Adam Burrell, a mechanical design engineer who has been building robots for 15 years at Boston Dynamics, including Petman, the YouTube­famous Atlas, and the dog­size quadruped called Spot."

      "text": "Burrell grew up a few blocks away from a Radio Shack in New York City. “If I was going to the subway station, we would walk right by Radio Shack. I would stop in and play with it and set the timer, do the challenges,” he says. “I know it was a toy, but that was a real robot.” The Armatron was the hook that lured him into Radio Shack and then sparked his lifelong interest in engineering: “I would roll pennies and use them to buy soldering irons and solder at Radio Shack.”"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 8,
      "text": "Burrell had a fateful reunion with the toy while in grad school for engineering. “One of my office mates had an Armatron at his desk,” he recalls, “and it was broken. We took it apart together, and that was the first time I had seen the guts of it."

      "question": "Based on the passage, the initial inspiration for the Armatron can best be described as:",
      "options": {
        "A": "A direct order from Watanabe's boss to replicate a specific design.",
        "B": "A reaction to a technological trend observed in the media.",
        "C": "A desire to create a tool for handling delicate objects like eggs.",
        "D": "A pre-existing project that Watanabe's team was already leading."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Watanabe recalls that the team saw the newspaper image and thought, 'This is where things are heading these days, so let’s make this.' This indicates they were inspired by a perceived trend, not a direct order (A), a specific application (C), or a pre-existing project (D).",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For inference questions, eliminate choices that are too literal or that introduce information not supported by the text. Focus on what the text implies."

        "A": "Describe the initial failure of the Armatron prototype.",
        "B": "Explain why Watanabe abandoned the project temporarily.",
        "C": "Highlight the collaborative nature of the team's work.",
        "D": "Introduce the design features that Watanabe found unsatisfactory."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The passage focuses on detailing the prototype's specific shortcomings: the hand's limited movement (90 degrees) and the cumbersome six-switch control panel, which Watanabe 'personally didn't like.'",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Identify the main subject and action of the passage. Here, the subject is the prototype's flaws, and the action is Watanabe's negative reaction to them."

      "question": "Which choice best describes the relationship between Watanabe's hobby and his work on the Armatron?",
      "options": {
        "A": "His hobby provided a functional model that he adapted to solve a design problem.",
        "B": "His hobby distracted him from his professional responsibilities, delaying the project.",
        "C": "His hobby was unrelated to his work but served as a metaphor for his ambitions.",
        "D": "His hobby created a technical standard that he was obligated to follow."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The passage states his breakthrough was 'inspired by' his RC helicopters. He directly applied the dual joystick control mechanism, figuring out how to map six movements onto it, solving the problem of the clumsy six-switch panel mentioned in the previous passage.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "To answer questions about relationships, look for signal words like 'inspired by' and examine how ideas from different sentences or passages connect logically."

        "C": "improve upon",
        "D": "integrate"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The context clues are 'adding touches' and 'seen on industrial robots.' The designer was adding decorative elements (like the non-functional rubber tubes) that imitated or copied the appearance of more serious, industrial machinery.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Replace the word in question with each answer choice and see which one maintains the original meaning and tone of the sentence without causing logical inconsistencies."

        "A": "a clever toy with limited practical application.",
        "B": "a significant and serious piece of robotic technology.",
        "C": "a threat to their own work on industrial robots.",
        "D": "a disappointing consumer product."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The text specifies that Watanabe heard from researchers and companies making industrial robots, not toy stores. Their feedback was 'encouraging,' and they 'often talked together.' This implies they saw it as a legitimate piece of technology worthy of professional discussion, not just a toy (A).",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Pay close attention to contrasts. The contrast between 'not...toy stores' and 'rather from researchers' is the key evidence for this inference."

      "options": {
        "A": "Both groups initially misunderstood the Armatron's intended purpose as a toy.",
        "B": "Both groups recognized the Armatron's technical merit and were influenced by it.",
        "C": "Burrell's experience contradicts the engineers' view, proving it was merely a toy.",
        "D": "The engineers sought to improve the Armatron, while Burrell was only a consumer."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Passage 1 shows professional engineers recognized its technical value. Passage 2 shows Burrell, a future engineer, also recognized its technical value ('that was a real robot'), and it directly sparked his career. Both groups saw beyond its toy status.",

        "D": "provide a humorous anecdote about his graduate school experiences."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This event follows the story of his childhood fascination. Taking it apart as a graduate engineer represents a deeper, more analytical level of engagement with the same object that first hooked him, showing how his curiosity persisted and matured.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "To determine the author's purpose for including a detail, ask yourself how that detail supports the broader point of the paragraph or passage. Here, it completes the arc of Burrell's story."

        "D": "project. By the time"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The second sentence explains the consequence of the first action. The transition requires a logical connection showing time and result, not contrast (A). A comma is the most fluid way to subordinate the time clause 'by the time he returned...' to the main clause, creating a single, smooth sentence.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When combining sentences, prioritize clarity and logical flow. Avoid creating a contrast where none exists and ensure the chosen punctuation correctly reflects the relationship between the ideas (e.g., cause-effect, sequence)."
