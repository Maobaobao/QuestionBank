      "text": "As Adams puts it, the Supreme Court treated school districts as though they were mini-states. But there is nothing more sovereign or God-given about school districts than there is about congressional districts. The boundaries are entirely a function of who is drawing the map."
    },

      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "Still, in a case decided two years after Swann, the Court doubled down. That case, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, was not about desegregation. Much of American publicschool funding comes from local property taxes, which is why the schools in suburban Detroit were so much better than the schools in the city. Rodriguez challenged this practice on the ground that it produced unequal results, with poor districts having much less to spend on education than affluent districts. The least affluent school district in San Antonio, Edgewood, was about ninety per cent Mexican American and six per cent Black. The most affluent, Alamo Heights, was eighteen per cent Mexican American and less than one per cent Black. Per-pupil expenditure in Edgewood was $356; in Alamo Heights, it was $594."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "The district court ruled that, because of this disparity, the plaintiffs had been denied equal protection. But the Supreme Court reversed the decision. The Court asked and answered two questions. The first was whether differences in wealth triggered “strict scrutiny” under the equal-protection clause. The Court said no. Poverty, unlike race, is not a “suspect class.” The poor have no special rights just because they’re poor. The second question was whether education is what courts call a fundamental right. Fundamental rights are rights the state is not supposed to deprive you of except under circumstances where the public good overwhelmingly outweighs the private harm. Some fundamental rights are enumerated in the Constitution: freedom of speech, the right to a jury trial, and so on. But some are not: the right to marry, to have custody over one’s children, to travel between states. When a fundamental right is at stake, courts are supposed to set a high bar for any encroachment on the right in question. In Rodriguez, however, the Court’s opinion, by Lewis Powell, held that education “is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected.”"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "But hadn’t Brown been all about the right to education? “Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments,” Earl Warren had written for a unanimous Court. “It is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” That sounds pretty fundamental."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Warren stopped short of explicitly saying so, however. There was a reason he didn’t, and Powell must have known what it was. Earlier in the century, the Supreme Court had declared “liberty of contract” to be a fundamental right and had used it to proclaim much New Deal legislation unconstitutional. Critics of the Court blamed it for inventing a right in order to pursue an economic agenda, and the Justices reversed their position after a few decades. Fundamental-rights talk was still highly unpopular in 1954. Warren did not want to go there. It would have looked as though the Court had an agenda."
