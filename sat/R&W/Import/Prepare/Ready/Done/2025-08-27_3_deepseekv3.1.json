      "text": "Artificial intelligence was barely a term in 1956, when top scientists from the field of computing arrived at Dartmouth College for a summer conference. The computer scientist John McCarthy had coined the phrase in the funding proposal for the event, a gathering to work through how to build machines that could use language, solve problems like humans, and improve themselves. But it was a good choice, one that captured the organizers’ founding premise: Any feature of human intelligence could “in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "In their proposal, the group had listed several “aspects of the artificial intelligence problem.” The last item on their list, and in hindsight perhaps the most difficult, was building a machine that could exhibit creativity and originality. At the time, psychologists were grappling with how to define and measure creativity in humans. The prevailing theory-that creativity was a product of intelligence and high IQ-was fading, but psychologists weren’t sure what to replace it with."

    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. AI-generated creative works-from orchestra performances to heavy metal-are poised to suffuse our lives more thoroughly than any other product of AI has done yet. The songs are likely to blend into our streaming platforms, party and wedding playlists, soundtracks, and more, whether or not we notice who (or what) made them."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "For years, diffusion models have stirred debate in the visual-art world about whether what they produce reflects true creation or mere replication. Now this debate has come for music, an art form that is deeply embedded in our experiences, memories, and social lives. Music models can now create songs capable of eliciting real emotional responses, presenting a stark example of how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "They came to a definition, first formalized in 1953 by the psychologist Morris Stein in the Journal of Psychology: Creative works are both novel, meaning they present something new, and useful, meaning they serve some purpose to someone. Some have called for “useful” to be replaced by “satisfying,” and others have pushed for a third criterion: that creative things are also surprising."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "A leading theory on what guides these two phases is called the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the most creative people can form novel connections between distant concepts. “It could be like spreading activation,” says Roger Beaty, a researcher who leads the Cognitive Neuroscience of Creativity Laboratory at Penn State. “You think of one thing; it just kind of activates related concepts to whatever that one concept is.”"

      "options": {
        "A": "explain the technical challenges faced at the Dartmouth conference.",
        "B": "describe the origin and founding principle of the term 'artificial intelligence.'",
        "C": "argue that John McCarthy was the most important figure in early computing.",
        "D": "contrast different definitions of human intelligence."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The passage focuses on the coining of the term 'artificial intelligence' by John McCarthy for the Dartmouth conference and explains the core premise behind it: that human intelligence can be simulated by a machine. The other choices are either too narrow (A), unsupported by the text (C), or not addressed (D).",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For main idea questions, identify the overarching subject and purpose of the passage. Avoid answers that focus on minor details or make claims not present in the text."

        "A": "permeate.",
        "B": "entertain.",
        "C": "isolate.",
        "D": "simplify."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The context describes AI-generated works blending into 'streaming platforms, party and wedding playlists, soundtracks, and more.' This suggests a widespread, pervasive presence. 'Permeate' means to spread throughout something, which is the closest synonym to 'suffuse' in this context.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For vocabulary-in-context questions, treat the word as a blank and test each answer choice in the sentence. Choose the one that maintains the original meaning and tone of the passage."

      "question": "Based on the passage, the state of psychology regarding creativity in the 1950s can best be described as",
      "options": {
        "A": "confidently unified under a single theory.",
        "B": "focused solely on its relationship with computing.",
        "C": "in a period of transition and uncertainty.",
        "D": "dismissive of its importance to artificial intelligence."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The passage states that the 'prevailing theory... was fading, but psychologists weren’t sure what to replace it with.' This directly indicates a transition away from an old theory and uncertainty about what new theory should take its place.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Inference questions require you to draw a logical conclusion based on evidence in the text. Look for keywords that indicate a state of being, like 'fading' and 'weren’t sure,' which point to uncertainty."

      "options": {
        "A": "highlight why music is a uniquely personal and impactful art form.",
        "B": "suggest that AI will be unable to understand human emotion.",
        "C": "explain the technical process behind music composition.",
        "D": "argue that visual art is less valuable than music."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The author uses this description to explain why the debate about AI creation is particularly significant and poignant for music. By establishing music's deep human connection, the author intensifies the stakes of the question about non-human authorship. The text does not support B, C, or D.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "When asked about the function of a detail, consider how it supports the author's larger argument. Ask yourself, 'Why did the author include this specific point here?'"

      "question": "Which choice most effectively combines the sentences at the underlined portion?<br><br>The Dartmouth organizers had one of their own. “The difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of some randomness,” they wrote, adding that such randomness “must be guided by intuition to be efficient.”",
      "options": {
        "A": "their own, and they wrote that 'the difference",
        "B": "their own: “The difference",
        "C": "their own; which was “The difference",
        "D": "their own, but they wrote “The difference"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The second sentence is a direct quotation that illustrates and explains the 'one of their own' (theory) mentioned in the first sentence. A colon is the correct punctuation to introduce such an explanation or elaboration. The other options create grammatical errors or logical inconsistencies (like 'but' which suggests contrast where none exists).",

      "passage": 7,
      "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the associative theory of creativity as described by Roger Beaty?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A study finds that practicing a musical instrument for 10,000 hours is the sole determinant of virtuosity.",
        "B": "Brain scans show that solving a math problem activates a single, highly specialized region of the brain.",
        "C": "An experiment demonstrates that poets generate more diverse word associations when given a prompt than non-poets do.",
        "D": "Research concludes that strict discipline and focused attention are the keys to successful invention."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The associative theory posits that creativity involves forming connections between distant concepts, which Beaty likens to 'spreading activation.' Finding that poets (creators) generate more diverse word associations directly supports the idea that their minds are making broader, more novel connections between concepts, which is the core of the theory. A, B, and D describe processes that are focused, specialized, or rigid, which contrast with the theory's emphasis on broad, associative thinking.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For evidence questions that ask you to apply a concept, first ensure you fully understand the theory or claim from the text. Then, evaluate which answer choice best exemplifies or reinforces that specific concept."

      "question": "How does the current approach of AI models, as described in the second passage, relate to the challenge outlined in the fisrt passage?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It has conclusively solved the challenge by perfectly replicating human intuition.",
        "B": "It represents a modern technological attempt to address what was identified as a difficult problem decades earlier.",
        "C": "It has proven that the Dartmouth organizers' theory about randomness was completely incorrect.",
        "D": "It focuses on a different aspect of AI, avoiding the problem of creativity entirely."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Passage 1 identifies machine creativity as 'perhaps the most difficult' aspect of AI. Passage 2 states that nearly 70 years later, modern AI models 'more or less follow that recipe' (the recipe of guided randomness proposed by the Dartmouth organizers to address creativity). This shows a direct lineage: a difficult challenge was identified, and current technology is an attempt to tackle it based on those early ideas.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For cross-text questions, mentally summarize the main point of each referenced passage. Your task is to find the answer that accurately describes the relationship (e.g., support, contrast, example) between these points."

      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "passage": 6,
      "question": "A student is writing a report on definitions of creativity. They want to include the definition from Morris Stein and the subsequent proposed revisions. Which choice most effectively uses the information from the passage to achieve this goal?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Morris Stein defined creativity as requiring novelty and usefulness, though some later theorists suggested replacing 'useful' with 'satisfying' or adding 'surprising' as a third criterion.",
        "B": "Morris Stein, writing in the Journal of Psychology, was the first psychologist to ever define creativity, which he said was novel and useful.",
        "C": "All theorists agree that Morris Stein's definition of creativity as 'novel and useful' is perfect and has not been revised since 1953.",
        "D": "The definition of creativity is hotly debated, with some favoring novelty, others usefulness, and others how satisfying or surprising something is."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This choice accurately and completely synthesizes the information from the passage. It states Stein's original two criteria (novel and useful) and then correctly incorporates the two proposed revisions mentioned in the text (replacing 'useful' with 'satisfying' and adding 'surprising' as a third criterion). The other choices are either incomplete (B, D) or factually incorrect based on the passage (C).",

        "D": "event: a gathering"
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The phrase 'a gathering to work through...' is an appositive phrase that renames and explains what 'the event' was. A colon is the most correct punctuation to introduce such an explanatory element. A comma is too weak, a semicolon (B) is used to separate independent clauses, and no punctuation (C) creates a run-on error.",
      "score_improvement_tip": "For punctuation questions, identify the grammatical function of the clauses and phrases. An appositive (a noun or phrase that renames another noun beside it) is often correctly set off by a comma, but when the explanation is more formal or follows a complete independent clause, a colon can be used."

        "D": "advances in AI are forcing a re-evaluation of fundamental artistic concepts."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The author does not state that the concepts are obsolete (A) or that AI is incapable (B); rather, the author presents a nuanced debate. The point is that the emergence of convincing AI art creates a new, complex situation that challenges our traditional, human-centric definitions of authorship and originality. This aligns with answer D. The passage suggests the legal disputes are in 'murky territory,' the opposite of simple (C).",
      "score_improvement_tip": "Pay close attention to the author's tone and precise wording. Phrases like 'it's becoming difficult to define' indicate a complex challenge, not a settled conclusion. Avoid extreme answers that use words like 'obsolete' or 'incapable' unless the author's tone is equally absolute."
