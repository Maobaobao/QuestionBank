I teach a class on social networking to MBA students at Columbia Business School, and a few years ago I invited Grunitzky to talk to us about his career and his approach to networking, which he prefers to call “developing social capital.” The key to building connections, he told us (and my own research subsequently confirmed), is to first arrive at a thorough understanding of your own identity—the interrelated elements that you use to define yourself. In Grunitzky’s case those elements include family roles such as father and husband, career roles such as CEO and journalist, an interest in jazz, and his Catholic faith. Only once you’ve identified the many facets of your identity, he continued, can you “identify commonality” with people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Commonalities provide a solid foundation on which to build and expand your network.

For earlier generations, venturing deliberately into the territory of identity was a discretionary act. The word identity wasn’t even used in social science to describe self-identification until the mid-1950s, and not until 1960 could citizens choose their own race for the U.S. Census. (Before then, census takers assigned it.) However, social scientists have since come to appreciate the importance of how people understand themselves, and they’ve conducted extensive research on the way your self-concept can affect your professional and personal lives.

I’m one of those researchers. I’ve spent years studying how leaders develop their personal identities, and my work supports Claude Grunitzky’s idea that to develop and expand a healthy professional network, you first need to focus on understanding your own identity. Doing that well can help you thrive both at work and in life. The good news is that you have more control over your identity than you may realize: You can curate it in ways that will improve your performance as a leader, the trust you’re able to inspire in others, and even your overall well-being.

Today we are constantly asked in the workplace to answer the question “Who are you?” There’s no avoiding it—especially if you’re in a leadership or a management role. Leaders project authenticity, and become trusted, by communicating their identities. When Captain Matt Feely was commanding officer of the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Logistics Center in Yokosuka, Japan, for example, he took each sailor, Marine, and Japanese civilian who joined his organization to the large globe in his office, where he pointed to the location of his hometown of Dedham, Massachusetts, and asked the newcomers to show him theirs.

Leaders also call on their identities when they need confidence and guidance. After the devastating Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011, Feely and the people in his organization were thrust into a leading role in the effort to save lives—and subsequently learned that during that effort they had been exposed to nuclear radiation. Upon receiving that news, Feely had a moment of darkness, wondering, “Why me?” Almost immediately, however, he thought about the experiences that had brought him to that moment: He had served in combat zones, previously led responses to natural disasters, and been in the Pentagon on 9/11. With all that in mind, he was able to ask himself a different question that allowed him to move forward as a leader: “Who better than me?”

If we’re socially connected to many others who have a particular identity element—if they consider themselves creative, say, or an athlete, or somebody who likes to cook—we’re more likely to adopt that element ourselves. Likewise, how we think of ourselves is to an extent a function of how others see us. In the end, our personal identities are partly the result of negotiations with others.

For example, creativity is a core element of my personal identity. If the people I work with did not consider me creative, and in fact snickered when I claimed to be, I wouldn’t be able to sustain creativity as part of my self-concept in their company. I’d have to adapt my sense of myself to conform to their view of me or I’d have to find others to work with who were more sympathetic to my self-image as creative. Either you take the lead in defining yourself or someone else will do it for you—and it’s infinitely better to do it yourself.

In her now-classic book Working Identity, Herminia Ibarra makes the case that successful career transitions depend on aligning your personal identity with the role you are transitioning to. She offers practical advice for achieving that alignment, such as experimenting with projects and activities—including outside work—to discover identity elements that will help you succeed in a new role. I particularly like her advice to tell and retell the story of why you’re the right person for the role you aspire to, and to adjust that story according to feedback from your interlocutors until you arrive at a version that works for you and for them. That’s a clever strategic response to the truth that our identities are negotiated with others.

Your identity will be most useful to you, of course, if you understand it as something you’ve defined for yourself rather than something that others have defined for you. Researchers recently confirmed this idea in an experiment that required subjects to solve a set of challenging math problems. Before putting the subjects to work, they primed some of them to affirm a view that they had of themselves and primed others to affirm a view that others had of them. The former group was asked to complete sentences such as “When I am a ______, I feel ______,” while the latter was asked to complete sentences such as “When I am a , I receive.” (Inputs in the first case might be “student” and “fulfilled” and in the second, “student” and “praise.”)

After completing their sentences, the members of these groups were given math problems to solve, and their results were compared with those of a control group. The subjects in the self-determined group performed better on the math problems than the control group, whereas those in the otherdetermined group performed worse. That finding has been confirmed in additional studies: Our identities serve us better when we understand them as self-determined. In interacting with others, it’s therefore important to be assertive in affirming who you are and how your various identity elements align with the roles you aspire to.

Research has also shown that our identities serve us better when we understand all their elements (no matter how diverse or even seemingly self-contradictory) as being harmonious. For example, the former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi writes in her autobiography of the importance of simultaneously maintaining her identities as an immigrant, a woman, an Indian, and a corporate executive and not choosing among them. Indeed, the title of her book—My Life in Full— evokes the idea of an integrated, harmonious identity. If we simply accept others’ characterizations of us, it’s hard to arrive at that feeling of harmony, because we all interact with many people, each of whom is likely to have a different view of who we really are. That’s cacophony, not harmony.

All this drives home just how important it is to affirm a rich sense of self that you can bring to the workplace. The best way to do that, I’ve found, is to come up with a singlepage document that lays out a detailed picture of who you understand yourself to be.

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
- In the questions, answers, explanations and score improvement tip, **don't show the passage number**.
