      "text": "Wilson is a live coder. Instead of using purpose-built software like most electronic music producers, live coders create music by writing the code to generate it on the fly. It’s an improvised performance art known as algorave.<br><br>“It’s kind of boring when you go to watch a show and someone’s just sitting there on their laptop,” she says. “You can enjoy the music, but there’s a performative aspect that’s missing. With live coding, everyone can see what it is that I’m typing. And when I’ve had my laptop crash, people really like that. They start cheering.”<br><br>Taking risks is part of the vibe. And so Wilson likes to dial up her performances one more notch by riffing off what she calls a live-coding agent, a generative AI model that comes up with its own beats and loops to add to the mix. Often the model suggests sound combinations that Wilson hadn’t thought of. “You get these elements of surprise,” she says. “You just have to go for it.”"

      "text": "Wilson, a researcher at the Creative Computing Institute at the University of the Arts London, is just one of many working on what’s known as co-creativity or more-than-human creativity. The idea is that AI can be used to inspire or critique creative projects, helping people make things that they would not have made by themselves. She and her colleagues built the live-coding agent to explore how artificial intelligence can be used to support human artistic endeavors-in Wilson’s case, musical improvisation. It’s a vision that goes beyond the promise of existing generative tools put out by companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Those can automate a striking range of creative tasks and offer near-instant gratification-but at what cost? Some artists and researchers fear that such technology could turn us into passive consumers of yet more AI slop."

      "text": "And so they are looking for ways to inject human creativity back into the process. The aim is to develop AI tools that augment our creativity rather than strip it from us-pushing us to be better at composing music, developing games, designing toys, and much more-and lay the groundwork for a future in which humans and machines create things together.<br><br>Ultimately, generative models could offer artists and designers a whole new medium, pushing them to make things that couldn’t have been made before, and give everyone creative superpowers."

      "text": "There’s no one way to be creative, but we all do it. We make everything from memes to masterpieces, infant doodles to industrial designs. There’s a mistaken belief, typically among adults, that creativity is something you grow out of. But being creative-whether cooking, singing in the shower, or putting together super-weird TikToks- is still something that most of us do just for the fun of it. It doesn’t have to be high art or a world-changing idea and yet it can be. Creativity is basic human behavior; it should be celebrated and encouraged."

      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "When generative text-to-image models like Midjourney, OpenAI’s DALL-E, and the popular opensource Stable Diffusion arrived, they sparked an explosion of what looked a lot like creativity. Millions of people were now able to create remarkable images of pretty much anything, in any style, with the click of a button. Text-to-video models came next. Now startups like Udio, are developing similar tools for music. Never before have the fruits of creation been within reach of so many.<br><br>But for a number of researchers and artists, the hype around these tools has warped the idea of what creativity really is. “If I ask the AI to create something for me, that’s not me being creative,” says Jeba Rezwana, who works on co-creativity at Towson University in Maryland. “It’s a one-shot interaction: You click on it and it generates something and that’s it. You cannot say ‘I like this part, but maybe change something here.’ You cannot have a back-and-forth dialogue.”"
