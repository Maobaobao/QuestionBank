## Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Understand the SAT Reading and Writing Domains and Skills**
Refer to the SAT Reading and Writing guide provided. Ensure the questions align with the **four content domains** and their respective skills:

- **Information and Ideas**: Measures comprehension, analysis, and reasoning skills and knowledge and the ability to locate, interpret, evaluate, and integrate information and ideas from texts and informational graphics (tables, bar graphs, and line graphs).
  - Central Ideas and Details
  - Command of Evidence (Textual, Quantitative)
  - Inferences
- **Craft and Structure**: Measures the comprehension, vocabulary, analysis, synthesis, and reasoning skills and knowledge needed to understand and use high-utility words and phrases in context, evaluate texts rhetorically, and make connections between topically related texts.
  - Words in Context
  - Text Structure and Purpose
  - Cross-Text Connections
- **Expression of Ideas**: Measures the ability to revise texts to improve the effectiveness of written expression and to meet specific rhetorical goals.
  - Rhetorical Synthesis
  - Transitions
- **Standard English Conventions**: Measures the ability to edit text to conform to core conventions of Standard English sentence structure, usage, and punctuation.

### **Step 2: Divide the Provided Article into Logical Passages**

Use the following provided parts of Essay (markdown format), **"Getting Big Things Done" by Toby Lester (Harvard Business Review USA, March-April, 2025)**, and pick from or merge the provided content into **multiple meaningful passages**. Each passage should：

- Be self-contained and coherent.
- Contains 1 or more paragraphs.
- Be suitable for generating one or two SAT-style questions.
- Include enough detail to support at least one question.
- Range from 25 to 150 words.

Reader, more than a quarter of a century has passed, and we still don’t have that bike path. Three new books help explain why that is—and why, so often in the United States, even when we have the political will, resources, and know-how, we just don’t seem to be able to get things done. High-speed rail? A transformed energy infrastructure? Affordable housing? We’ve been talking about those goals for decades. In the past century we managed to electrify rural America, create Social Security and Medicare, and construct the interstate highway system, each in less time than my town has spent trying to get its little bike path built. So where did we go wrong?

Marc Dunkelman, a fellow at Brown University and the author of the eye-opening Why Nothing Works, argues that progressives— a group he identifies with— deserve much, though not all, of the blame. He points to a paradox at the heart of the movement: Progressives want to pull power up and concentrate it in a person or an agency that can solve problems from the top down (to respond to, say, climate change), but they also want to push power down to the people (to ensure that no central authority can, for example, tell women what they’re allowed to do with their bodies).

These competing approaches to governing have been the yin and yang of the American project since the days of Alexander Hamilton (who believed in centralized power) and Thomas Jefferson (who wanted to keep it in check). In the first half of the 20th century, the Hamiltonian impulse was ascendant, but in the second half the balance shifted toward the Jeffersonian, Dunkelman writes, after reformers began to realize that the establishment was responsible for such abuses of power as “‘slum clearance,’ the country’s disastrous reliance on foreign oil, the glut of pollution, and…rampant corruption.” In response, progressives instituted checks on government designed to give a greater say and more agency to the people, but in doing so they created a “vetocracy” that allows almost anybody to raise objections to and stall projects. And now we’re hamstrung: Many of the reforms introduced to keep public officials from doing bad are preventing them from doing good. Solving that problem, Dunkelman concludes, will require a change of mindset: “In a phrase, it will mean giving communities a voice but not a veto.”

Yoni Appelbaum, a deputy executive editor at The Atlantic, comes to a related conclusion in his engagingly written Stuck. The secret to American success, he writes, has long been mobility, which has “produced an unprecedented degree of social fluidity.” Today, however, mobility in the United States is in steep decline: An alarming number of people simply can’t afford to relocate in search of better lives. They’re stuck—geographically, socially, professionally, and economically.

What changed? According to Appelbaum, much of the problem can be traced to the tangle of building codes, restrictive covenants, and zoning ordinances that reformers (again, mainly progressives) have implemented over the past several decades, ostensibly to push power down to the people. Whether enacted in good faith or designed with exclusionary intent, those policies have led to vetocracy. As Appelbaum puts it, “Almost all new construction in the United States now requires government approval, and anyone with sufficient time and resources and education can effectively veto that approval, or at least impose great expense and delay. The result is that, in the very places that need it most desperately, housing has become prohibitively difficult to build.”

Because of this, Appelbaum argues, it’s not right to say that we have an affordable-housing shortage today. There are many places, especially in red states, where existing stock is plentiful and new construction is relatively cheap. But those locations aren’t where the jobs are, which has led to a terrible irony. “The places that today offer the greatest opportunities have grown exclusionary,” Appelbaum writes. “Progressive communities…which pride themselves on their openness and tolerance and diversity and commitment to social justice, are the worst offenders.”

Appelbaum offers many thoughts about how to address this problem, but ultimately his prescription is simple: We need to significantly relax and simplify our building codes and zoning restrictions so that construction projects can move forward according to a clear set of rules and without special permissions or time-consuming reviews—much as the Japanese have managed to do in Tokyo. And once we’ve done that, he writes, it will be time “to build such an abundant supply of housing that it reverts to being a consumer good and not an investment asset.”

### **Step 3: Generate SAT Reading and Writing Questions**

For each passage, create questions that match the **requested difficulty levels**:

- **Easy**: 20% of questions (2 questions)
- **Medium**: 30% of questions (3 questions)
- **Hard**: 50% of questions (5 questions)

Ensure the questions:

- Are aligned with the SAT Reading and Writing domains and skills.
- Include a mix of **text-based**, **graphical** (if applicable), **analytical** and **vocabulary-based** questions.
- Are clear, concise, and free from ambiguity.
- Include **answer explanations** and **score improvement tips**.
- In the questions, answers, explanations and score improvement tip, **don't show the passage number**.
