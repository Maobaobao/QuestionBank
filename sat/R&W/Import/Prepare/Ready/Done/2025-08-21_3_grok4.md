Data has been part of the story of paid work and power since the late 19th century, when manufacturing was booming in the US and a rise in immigration meant cheap
and plentiful labor. The mechanical engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor, who would become one of the first management consultants, created a strategy called “scientific management” to optimize production by tracking and setting standards for worker performance. Soon after, Henry Ford broke down the auto manufacturing process into mechanized steps to minimize the role of individual skill and maximize the number of cars that could be produced each day. But the transformation of workers into numbers has a longer history. Some researchers see a direct line between Taylor’s and Ford’s unrelenting focus on efficiency and the dehumanizing
labor optimization practices carried out on slave-owning plantations.

As manufacturers adopted Taylorism and its successors, time was replaced by productivity as the measure of work, and the power divide between owners and workers in the United States widened. But other developments soon helped rebalance the scales. In 1914, Section 6 of the Clayton Act established the federal legal right for workers to unionize and stated that “the labor of a human being is not a commodity.” In the years that followed, union membership grew, and the 40-hour work week and the minimum wage were written into US law. Though the nature of work had changed with revolutions in technology and management strategy, new frameworks and guardrails stood up to meet that change.

More than a hundred years after Taylor published his seminal book, The Principles of Scientific Management, “efficiency” is still a business buzzword, and technological developments, including new uses of data, have brought work to another turning point. But the federal minimum wage and other worker protections haven’t kept up, leaving the power divide even starker. In 2023, CEO pay was 290 times average worker pay, a disparity that’s increased more than 1,000% since 1978. Data may play the same kind of intermediary role in the boss-worker relationship that it has since the turn of the 20th century, but the scale has exploded. And the stakes can be a matter of physical health.

In 2024, a report from a Senate committee led by Bernie Sanders, based on an 18-month investigation of Amazon’s warehouse practices, found that the company had been
setting the pace of work in those facilities with black-box algorithms, presumably calibrated with data collected by monitoring employees. In California, because of a 2021 bill, Amazon is required to at least reveal the quotas and standards workers are expected to comply with; elsewhere the bar can remain a mystery to the very people struggling to meet it. The report also found that in each of the previous seven years, Amazon workers had been almost twice as likely to be injured as other warehouse workers, with injuries ranging from concussions to torn rotator cuffs to long-term back pain.

The Sanders report found that between 2020 and 2022, two internal Amazon teams tasked with evaluating warehouse safety recommended reducing the required pace of work and giving workers more time off. Another found that letting robots set the pace for human labor was correlated with subsequent injuries. The company rejected all the recommendations for technical or productivity reasons. But the report goes on to reveal that in 2022, another team at Amazon, called Core AI, also evaluated warehouse safety and concluded that unrealistic pacing wasn’t the reason all those workers were getting hurt on the job. Core AI said that the cause, instead, was workers’ “frailty” and “intrinsic likelihood of injury.” The issue was the limitations of the human bodies the company was measuring, not the pressures it was subjecting those bodies to. Amazon stood by this reasoning during the congressional investigation. Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel told MIT Technology Review that the Sanders report is “wrong on the facts” and that the company continues to reduce incident rates for accidents. “The facts are,” she said, “our expectations for our employees are safe and reasonableand that was validated both by a judge in Washington after a thorough hearing and by the state’s Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals.”

Yet this line of thinking is hardly unique to Amazon, although the company could be seen as a pioneer in the datafication of work. An investigation found that over one year between 2017 and 2018, the company fired hundreds of workers at a single facilityby means of automatically generated lettersfor not meeting roductivity quotas. An AI startup recently placed a series of billboards and bus signs in the Bay Area touting the benefits of its automated sales agents, which it calls “Artisans,” over human workers. “Artisans won’t complain about work-life balance,” one said. “Artisans won’t come into work hungover,” claimed another.
“Stop hiring humans,” one hammered home. The startup’s leader-ship took to the company blog to say that the marketing campaign was intentionally provocative and that Artisan believes in the potential of human labor. But the company also asserted that using one of its AI agents costs 96% less than hiring a human to do the same job. The campaign hit a nerve: When data is king, humanswhether warehouse laborers or knowledge workersmay not be able to outperform machines.

Companies that use electronic employee monitoring report that they are most often looking to the technologies not only to increase productivity but also to manage
risk. And software like Teramind offers tools and analysis to help with both priorities. While Teramind, a globally distributed company, keeps its list of over 10,000 client companies private, it provides resources for the financial, health-care, and customer service industries, among otherssome of which have strict
compliance requirements that can be tricky to keep on top of. The platform allows clients to set data-driven standards for productivity, establish thresholds for alerts about toxic communication tone or language, create tracking systems for sensitive file sharing, and more. With the increase in remote and hybrid work, says Teramind’s chief marketing officer, Maria Osipova, the company’s product strategy has shifted from tracking time spent on tasks to monitoring productivity and security more broadly, because that’s what clients want. “It’s a different set of challenges that the tools have had to evolve to address as we’re moving into fully hybrid work,” says Osipova. “It’s this transition from ‘Do people work?’ or ‘How long do they work?’ to ‘How do they work best?’ How do we as an organization understand where and how and under what conditions they work best? And also, how do I de-risk my company when I give that amount of trust?”

The clients’ myriad use cases and risks demand a very robust platform that can monitor multiple types of input. “So think about what applications are being used. Think about being able to turn on the conversations that are happening on video or audio as needed, but also with a great amount of flexibility,” says Osipova. “It’s not that it’s a camera that’s always watching over you.” Selecting and tuning the appropriate combination of data is up to Teramind’s clients and depends on
the size, goals, and capabilities of the particular company. The companies are also the ones to decide, based on their legal and compliance requirements, what measures to take if thresholds for negative behavior or low performance are hit.

But however carefully it’s implemented, the very existence of electronic monitoring may make it difficult for employees to feel safe and perform well. Multiple studies have shown that monitoring greatly increases worker stress and can break down trust between an employer and its workforce. One 2022 poll of tech workers found that roughly half would rather quit than be monitored. And when algorithmic management comes into the picture, employees may have a harder time being successfuland understanding what success even means.
