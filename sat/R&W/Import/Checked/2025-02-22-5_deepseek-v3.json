        "text": "Today, Poweshiek skipperlings are ferried to adulthood in the back seat of a Subaru Outback. The ride from the Minnesota Zoo to Michigan is the culmination of their new, human-directed life cycle. They make the journey still wrapped in their cocoons, no longer caterpillars but not quite yet butterflies, each one attached to a small tuft of prairie dropseed growing from a plastic pot and wrapped in a protective tower of pantyhose-covered metal framing. Nordmeyer drives the Poweshieks to Michigan, where he sets up the pots like a miniature city of beige condominiums inside a collapsible picnic shelter on site. He calls it the “Poweshiek Party Tent.”"

        "text": "As each cocoon opens, the butterfly that emerges is released into the wild. Two or three at a time, Nordmeyer marks their wings with an identifying dot from a colored Sharpie, loads them into test tubes and carries them out onto the prairie in a messenger bag. He lowers them carefully by the bristly end of a paintbrush onto the waiting petals of a black-eyed Susan, their favorite flower. Over the course of a couple of weeks in 2022, Nordmeyer and his colleagues released 102 butterflies and searched the grasses for pregnant females and already laid eggs to carry back to the zoo. The caterpillars that later hatched from those eggs went on to eat their way through their own potted prairie dropseeds. In the summer, they were loaded into special cooling boxes that can mimic the overnight temperature drops that no longer happen reliably in this part of the country. As the seasons turned, humans plucked the fat babies from the plants and packed them into plastic cups filled with clay. The cups are covered with paper towels and stored in a freezer, the analogue of a caterpillar buried beneath a thick snowpack. In the spring, they’ll go back on a dropseed, spin a cocoon, and wait for their cross-country road trip in that Subaru—the new year’s butterfly crop."

        "text": "Nordmeyer isn’t the only one working to save the Poweshiek. At the John Ball Zoo in Michigan, scientists have figured out how to breed Poweshieks right there in captivity, no need to drop them off in a field so they can find dates. In Manitoba, researchers are monitoring Poweshiek numbers and working to figure out both what kinds of habitats the butterflies prefer and ways of keeping those habitats healthy and safe."

        "text": "Twenty years ago, when Dana first called Richard Westwood, a professor of biology at the University of Winnipeg, and asked him if he’d noticed anything odd about the Poweshieks in his area, Westwood’s response was “I don’t know. They’re always around right? We don’t really pay attention.” Today, they are a species Westwood and dozens of other scientists have spent years paying intense attention to."

        "text": "The Poweshieks’ transition from a species humans neglected to one whose life is now literally in our hands is a reflection of how we’ve approached insects, as a whole. For every charismatic megafauna gracing the cover of a magazine, there are literal armfuls of smaller creatures fading quietly into the night. Insects are threatened at a rate far exceeding that of mammals, birds, and reptiles, with as much as 40 percent of all insect species potentially facing extinction in the next few decades. Butterflies are one of the most affected groups, but they weren’t a major focus of conservation science until recently. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the agency that evaluates the conservation status of species and helps determine which are threatened, has assessed the risks posed to 67 percent of vertebrate species but only 2 percent of invertebrates, as of 2019."

        "text": "Saving those species is an exercise in just how much control we can take over nature before we’re not only preserving it but also molding it. The people working to save the Poweshiek know they’re walking that tightrope. And they also know it’s not something that we have enough resources to do for every species that’s in danger of extinction. Choices will have to be made."

        "text": "That reality represents a big shift in the way both science and policy have thought about animal conservation, said Daniel Rohlf, a professor of wildlife law at Lewis & Clark Law School. There’s a can-do attitude that’s embedded into the law and regulations that govern how species are managed. The Endangered Species Act defines the very concept of “conservation” as doing whatever is necessary to ensure every listed species no longer needs the ESA. “The overwhelming attitude was, ‘Humans have kind of messed this up, but we can fix it,’” Rohlf said. Species become endangered, but then humans come in, identify what went wrong, correct the problem, and help the species rebuild until eventually it stops needing our intervention."

        "text": "There have definitely been some species for which that understanding of the world has worked. Melinda Morgan, director of the sustainability studies program at the University of New Mexico, pointed to the success we’ve had in saving the peregrine falcon. “Ban DDT and you’re great. Done,” she said, referring to the once-common bird-killing pesticide. But the reality is that most endangered animals will not be large and iconic, with an easily identified threat that can be quickly eliminated with one weird trick, like in a clickbait ad. Most are insects, small and hard to find, easier to accidentally kill without thinking about it than to find and rescue. Most are suffering from a tangle of intertwined problems. For the Poweshiek, there are pesticides we won’t stop using, land we won’t stop developing, and climate that won’t stop changing. If you resuscitate the species in a zoo, it may or may not have a wild habitat to return to. Most endangered animals are not the peregrine falcon. Most endangered animals are a mess."

        "text": "“There’s a level of overwhelm that comes with that,” Morgan said. “There’s a level of despair.” What do you do when a species you thought was fine turns out to be actually teetering on the brink of death? What do you do when you have to decide which species you’ll focus your grants and labs and manpower on, knowing there are others in just as dire straits? What do you do when you have basically become a minor deity to a species of butterfly that relies on you to guide its life across generations—and the damn thing won’t be fruitful and multiply?"

        "text": "This is the point where Morgan suggested I speak to a Buddhist philosopher.<br><br>Three years ago, researchers from the Minnesota Zoo took one of the Poweshieks they’d painstakingly raised from birth, released it onto the Michigan prairie, and watched in frustration as a mint-green dragonfly, the size of a human palm, dropped out of the sky . . . and ate it.<br><br>There are no guarantees in nature. Not even when everything is working the way it’s supposed to—maybe especially not then. The dragonfly, a common pondhawk, was also native to those swampy grasslands. “It sort of forced us to stop and think,” Nordmeyer said. “That’s also a natural species, right? This is part of the natural order of things then, too.”"
