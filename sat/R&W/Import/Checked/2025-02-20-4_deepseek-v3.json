        "text": "Several new studies of UV-IR mixing and how it might solve naturalness problems refer back to two papers that appeared in 1999. “There is a growth of interest in these more exotic, non-EFT-like solutions to these problems,” said Patrick Draper, a professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, whose recent work picks up where one of the 1999 papers left off."

        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Draper and his colleagues study the CKN bound, named for the authors of the ’99 paper, Andrew Cohen, David B. Kaplan, and Ann Nelson. The authors thought about how, if you put particles in a box and heat it up, you can increase the energy of the particles only so much before the box collapses into a black hole. They calculated that the number of high-energy particle states you can fit in the box before it collapses is proportional to the box’s surface area raised to the three-fourths power, not the box’s volume, as you might think. They realized that this represented a strange UV-IR relationship. The size of the box, which sets the IR scale, severely limits the number of high-energy particle states within the box—the UV scale."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "They then realized that if their same bound applies to our entire universe, it resolves the cosmological constant problem. In this scenario, the observable universe is like a very large box. And the number of high-energy particle states it can contain is proportional to the observable universe’s surface area to the three-fourths power, not the universe’s (much larger) volume."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "That means the usual EFT calculation of the cosmological constant is too naive. That calculation tells the story that high-energy phenomena should appear when you zoom in on the fabric of space, and this should blow up the energy of space. But the CKN bound implies that there may be far, far less high-energy activity than the EFT calculation assumes—meaning precious few high-energy states available for particles to occupy. Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson did a simple calculation showing that, for a box the size of our universe, their bound predicts more or less exactly the tiny value for the cosmological constant that’s observed."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "Their calculation implies that big and small scales might correlate with each other in a way that becomes apparent when you look at an IR property of the whole universe, such as the cosmological constant. Draper and Nikita Blinov confirmed in another crude calculation last year that the CKN bound predicts the observed cosmological constant; they also showed that it does so without ruining the many successes of EFT in smaller-scale experiments."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "The CKN bound doesn’t tell you why the UV and IR are correlated—why, that is, the size of the box (the IR) severely limits the number of high-energy states within the box (the UV). For that, you probably need to know quantum gravity. Other researchers have looked for answers in a specific theory of quantum gravity: string theory. Last summer, the string theorists Steven Abel and Keith Dienes showed how UV-IR mixing in string theory might address both the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "A candidate for the fundamental theory of gravity and everything else, string theory holds that all particles are, close up, little vibrating strings. Standard Model particles like photons and electrons are low-energy vibration modes of the fundamental string. But the string can wiggle more energetically as well, giving rise to an infinite spectrum of string states with ever-higher energies. The hierarchy problem, in this context, asks why corrections from these string states don’t inflate the Higgs, if there’s nothing like supersymmetry to protect it."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Dienes and Abel calculated that, because of a different symmetry of string theory called modular invariance, corrections from string states at all energies in the infinite spectrum from IR to UV will be correlated in just the right way to cancel out, keeping both the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant small. The researchers noted that this conspiracy between low- and high-energy string states doesn’t explain why the Higgs mass and the Planck energy are so widely separated to begin with, only that such a separation is stable. Still, in Craig’s opinion, “it’s a really good idea.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "The new models represent a growing grab bag of UV-IR mixing ideas. Craig’s angle of attack traces back to the other 1999 paper, by the prominent theorist Nathan Seiberg of the Institute for Advanced Study and two coauthors. They studied situations where there’s a background magnetic field filling space. To get the gist of how UV-IR mixing arises here, imagine a pair of oppositely charged particles attached by a spring and flying through space, perpendicular to the magnetic field. As you crank up the field’s energy, the charged particles accelerate apart, stretching the spring. In this toy scenario, higher energies correspond to longer distances."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "Seiberg and company found that the UV corrections in this situation have peculiar features that illustrate how the reductionist arrow can be spun round, so that the IR affects what happens in the UV. The model isn’t realistic, because the real universe doesn’t have a magnetic field imposing a background directionality. Still, Craig has been exploring whether anything like it could work as a solution to the hierarchy problem. Craig, Garcia Garcia, and Seth Koren have also jointly studied how an argument about quantum gravity called the weak gravity conjecture, if true, might impose consistency conditions that naturally require a huge separation between the Higgs mass and the Planck scale."
