        "text": "In the spring of 2017, as illegal border crossings were undergoing their typical seasonal spike, Jeff Self, the Border Patrol chief in El Paso, Texas, acted on a general message that he and other sector chiefs had received after Trump’s election—to work with their local counterparts at the Department of Justice to crack down on border crossings in service of the new president’s agenda. Self decided that the best way to do that would be for his agents to start referring parents traveling with children for prosecution. Though he likely didn’t realize it at the time, Self was laying the groundwork for a national policy that called for separating families. Federal officials would later call his local initiative a 'pilot' and use it as a model for expanding the practice nationwide. (Self declined to comment for this story.)"

        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "A Border Patrol agent working under Self emailed an assistant U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas about the departure from prior practice. Though phrased in such a way as to suggest an insignificant administrative change, the email was in fact describing a revival of the idea Tom Homan had proposed to Jeh Johnson in 2014—using prosecution and family separations as a means of deterring would-be migrants."

        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "At the time, the Western District of Texas was being run by Richard Durbin, who was keeping the U.S. attorney’s seat warm until a Trump appointee could be nominated and confirmed. Durbin, who had been with the office for decades, responded to the policy change with skepticism. 'History would not judge that kindly,' he wrote to his colleagues. Though Durbin agreed that exempting all parents from prosecution seemed unwise, he said he had 'no confidence' in the Border Patrol’s ability to determine which ones deserved to face prosecution. 'We don’t want small children separated from parents and placed into some bureaucratic child services or foster agency in limbo.'"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "Durbin eventually consented to prosecuting some parents, but he wanted to focus on those who were also being accused of much more serious crimes. 'If culpability is very low and they have their own children we don’t need to prosecute,' he wrote in an email. 'If they are a sicario [cartel hit man] we should prosecute and figure out how to deal humanely with children.'"

        "text": "But the instructions sent to Border Patrol agents, which I obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, contain none of the limitations Durbin requested, instead emphasizing that 'the US Attorney’s office will be contacted to seek prosecution for the adults of every family unit arrested.' The document is dedicated mostly to warning agents against contacting assistant U.S. attorneys about the cases late at night or on weekends. It does not contain any guidance on how to separate parents and children or what each should be told about what was happening."

'I was bamboozled,' Durbin reportedly said. 'They didn’t care about our prosecutions. They wanted a reason for separating children from parents.'"

        "text": "Wesley Farris, a Border Patrol agent in El Paso, was asked to handle some of the separation cases. In one instance, a boy who was about two years old grabbed onto him in confusion, refusing to let go. 'The world was upside down to that kid,' Farris told PBS’s Frontline. 'That one got me.' Farris told his supervisor afterward not to assign him to separation cases anymore. 'That was the most horrible thing I’ve ever done,' he recalled. 'You can’t help but see your own kids.'"

        "text": "Meanwhile, the El Paso Border Patrol immediately started looking to expand Jeff Self’s initiative to New Mexico. 'Although it is always a difficult decision to separate these families,' an agent wrote to the acting U.S. attorney there, 'it is the hope that this separation will act as a deterrent to parents bringing their children into the harsh circumstances that are present when trying to enter the United States illegally.' Some separations also occurred in Yuma, Arizona, under a separate initiative."

'Having to get really firm with someone who was crying and upset because they didn’t know where their kid was was heartbreaking,' she told me."

Núñez only realized months later that by the time her clients were returned to immigration custody, many of their children had been sent to shelters in different states."
