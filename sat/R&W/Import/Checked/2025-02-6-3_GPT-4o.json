        "text": "She was lithe, slim, and so pale that when her cheeks flushed the pink seemed almost painted in watercolor onto her iridescent white skin. Thick blond hair spilled over her shoulders and down her back, and her wide, sapphire-blue eyes gave her an aura of innocence and delight. This small, lovely creature embodied fully the clean goodness of our shared religious universe. In the ceremonies and the services that the congregation came together to perform, she flowed effortlessly into the spirit of collective holiness to which every other participant was, to varying degrees, failing to give themselves over. Quiet, modest, tiny, and sweet, she was a model member of our community—a chosen one among God’s chosen people. In the knee-length skirts and simple long-sleeved blouses that we were required to wear at our Modern Orthodox Jewish high school, she was wholly comfortable and naturally pure—so far above and worlds away from anything crude or even complicated. It was mesmerizing, the way those clothes wrapped her body, the way her little hip bones gently punctuated the folds of her skirt and her shoulder blades were just barely visible beneath the flowing fabric. She was sublimely delicate. For four years I adored her, and the adoration flickered into an obsession, not because I wanted her but because I wanted to be like her, and if I could not be like her—as I was later to discover, brutally, I could not—I would be near her, study her, and admire her."

        "text": "We met first when I had just become what I would always remain within that world—an outsider, thrown into and enamored of the peculiar energy of Modern Orthodox Judaism, and especially of Modern Orthodox Jewish women. It seemed to me that all of the many laws governing the temperaments, the orientations, and the actions of Modern Orthodox Jewesses were designed to create a girl just like her. There are so many rules and restrictions, so many carefully delineated categories. Consider only the room, the “sanctuary,” of a Modern Orthodox Jewish synagogue. Through it runs a mechitzah, or partition, which divides the men from the women. In the men’s section is the closet or “ark” which contains the Torah, toward which the congregation faces; and the bimah, or stage, on which stands the shulchan, or table, from which the Torah is read; and near it the amud, or podium, from which the shaliach tzibur, or “messenger of the congregation,” leads the service. From their seats in the women’s section, the women watch the ritual and liturgical action of the men, except in those synagogues in which they cannot adequately see it—there they merely listen. Men can be rabbis and women cannot, and this, coupled with the centrality of the male section of the sanctuary, conditions women to be comfortable as quiet spectators. (We were often told that men need to be bribed with positions of leadership to convince them to participate in rituals, whereas women, naturally holier, are inclined independently to worship.)"

        "text": "Men and women who are not related to one another are forbidden any form of physical touch, and even husbands and wives are forbidden from touching while the woman has her period because menstruation renders her impure, a condition that can be remedied by her immersion in a mikvah, or ritual bath when her period ends. A woman must at all times be tznuah, or modest. The practices of tznius vary from community to community, but broadly they require that when in public a woman’s skirts must cover the knees, shirts must cover the collarbone and the elbows, and married women must cover their hair."

        "text": "These are all facets of Orthodox Jewish life which are the products of concrete and time-honored laws, which, with the proper training or guidance, one can look up and read for oneself. All of these statutes, and the cultural etiquettes and norms—the minhagim or customs—that are more powerful for not being written down, conjure an image of femininity entirely fulfilled by that tiny blonde’s chaste, cherubic smile."
