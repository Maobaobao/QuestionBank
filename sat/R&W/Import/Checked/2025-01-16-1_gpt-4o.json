      "text": "Air France, first-class cabin, the boredom ameliorated by champagne and Cognac and the in-flight cuisine, which only the French, Germans, and Dutch still seemed to care about, though he wasn’t particularly hungry, not after three glasses of Taittinger, so he sat back and engaged with a new novel by one of his rivals, which so maddened him with its grace and fluidity that he finally had to put it aside and just stare out the window until the clouds below crept inside his skull and everything went pleasantly fuzzy, though he didn’t sleep."

      "text": "Across the aisle from him, in her own pod, was a woman of thirty or so with a honed physique and a face that wasn’t conventionally pretty but was darkly erotic like that of a French actress from the sixties whose name he could never remember. Before takeoff, she’d talked on her phone in very bad Spanish to her maid or housekeeper or au pair about her daughter’s needs and expectations, then washed down two tiny white pills with her champagne and fallen unconscious."

      "text": "The good news was that Mireille was waiting for him in the arrivals hall. She was his editor, the granddaughter of the man who had founded the publishing house, and since all editorial decisions were made in New York long before the manuscript reached her desk their relationship was relatively uncomplicated. She vetted the translation, and if it passed muster with her he was fine with that, because he wasn’t about to blunder through it himself, even with Google to fluently obfuscate things for him."
