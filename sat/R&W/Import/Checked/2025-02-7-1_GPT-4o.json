        "text": "It wasn’t long before I heard splashing and my brother’s laugh. Up ahead, Eli sprinted down the metal dock and cannonballed into the lake. Lawn Boy had steered us back to shore. How long had we been out there? I didn’t know. It was like we’d never left. If only I’d known no one was missing us, I would have stayed gone longer."

        "text": "Shortly after our night in the canoe, Lawn Boy came down with a migraine that lasted several days. On the first day, he drove the mower into a tree. My mother ordered him to rest. I checked on him hourly, trying not to be too obvious. A single window offered a glimpse into his shed. Passing, I stalled there, watched the outline of his sleeping body until his chest rose and fell, until his shoulders twitched. On the third day, I lifted the handle and opened his door. His shed smelled like a barn, trapped creature-heat and no fresh air. A belt hung from a nail, and I found a gray towel tossed over a chair and used it to dab his forehead. For a while, I sat on the hard floor beside his pillow, counting his breaths, staring at his things. His watch, with its broken minute hand, a stick of deodorant, a metal spoon. Once, he cried out, and I pressed my fingers to his whiskers, damp with sweat. I wondered if he was here to raid the infirmary for drugs once the sick kids came. Well, good for him, I thought. None of this took away from the fact that he’d made me feel less alone, that he’d seen my ugliness and wasn’t repulsed by it. I didn’t want to leave him. I wanted to crawl into his bed and cling on tight, but the campers were coming in five days. I had things to do."

        "text": "That night, Lawn Boy didn’t come to the fire. I mentioned a sore throat, said goodnight early, hit the path back up the hill. Soon, I was on the part of the trail that was too far from the beach to catch the boathouse lights, too far from the Mess Hall to catch the glow of the orange lamps. A pale streak flashed through the brush in front of me. I rushed to follow it as it sliced between trees. It stopped at the private beach, where a tree stretched over the lake’s edge, shielding the shore from public view. At first, I didn’t recognize my mother, naked except for a towel wrapped over her breasts. Her hair ran over her shoulders. She wandered out to the water. She had a beautiful back. Straight and proud, without scars or birthmarks. I’d forgotten this. When she crouched down, the water wet the ends of her hair. I longed to go to her, swim to her, in only the skin I was born in, but there was no going back. This was something no one told you. In a family, you didn’t lose one person. You lost one person, and everyone changed. My mother went under. Ripples radiated from the spot where her head had been. I wanted to touch that spot, submerge my fingers. Maybe the water carried her electricity. Maybe, in this small way, we could still connect. I couldn’t bear for her to see my spying. I dug my fingernails into a tree. When my mother resurfaced, her hair glistened in the moonlight. I wondered if she was waiting for a sign from Emeline too."

        "text": "On the night the counselors arrived, Angus the Cook served a banquet of chicken patties. My mother welcomed the staff and read aloud the names of campers arriving the next day. A boy from New Mexico who was allergic to sunlight, a girl from Minneapolis who’d lost eight bones in her face. Two kids with epilepsy, one with leukemia, a crew with asthma. Nurse Shelby, poached from a pediatric clinic in Boston, tapped the point of her pen against her teeth. The counselors hailed from all over the world. Elka was from Norway. Claudette was from France. It felt like an invasion. All through the meal, I looked at Lawn Boy, noticing the way his beard and face changed shape in response to small talk he didn’t join in. Halfway through, he got up and disappeared. When he came back, he whispered, “Libs, I got you Kahlua for our last bonfire.”"

        "text": "Around nine, it began to pour. Plan B was the boathouse. There, we gathered as rain lashed the trees. We were all sopping wet. I dug through the plastic QuikMart bags until I found the four-pack of premixed Kahlua cocktails Lawn Boy had bought me. Reid unearthed a funnel from a backpack and showed Eli how to raise the cone part high to make the beer gush down his throat. We talked about people we knew who’d gotten their stomachs pumped in high school. Lawn Boy walked to the sliding door. It was open, and you could edge right up to a wall of falling water, break in with your nose, while the rest of you stayed dry. I reached up and touched Lawn Boy’s chin. After dinner, he’d shaved his whiskers."
