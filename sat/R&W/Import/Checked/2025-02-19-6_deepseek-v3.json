        "text": "When I showed up at Rangina’s house, there were no guards outside anymore, and her government-issued armored SUV was gone from the driveway. When the Taliban had taken it, they’d assured her she would be safe. But she was getting ready to evacuate; there was only a week remaining until August 31, the deadline for the troops to leave, and she and Abdullah had decided to take Zara and get out."

        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "The day before, Rangina had been invited to a meeting at the ministry with members of the Taliban’s education commission. Schools were closed since the collapse of the republic, but Rangina had wondered if they might ask her to continue in a temporary capacity, like Waheed Majrooh, the minister of public health, who’d remained and helped keep the hospitals running through the violence at the airport. Rangina arrived with her deputy to find several older men in turbans sitting in her office. They were formal but polite; one turned out to be from a village in Kandahar next to her father’s. Together, they went to speak to the ministry’s senior staff. After thanking God for their victory, one of the Taliban officials gave a speech about placing Islam at the center of a new curriculum—now their fundamentalist vision would shape the next generation of Afghan children."

        "text": "Afterward, the officials served her melon in the office. She wanted to know whether girls would be denied higher education as they were in the 1990s. The Taliban assured her that they would be allowed to study past sixth grade, but only after a system was worked out to keep men and women separate, in accordance with religious law."

        "text": "“I don’t know if their definition of Shariah has changed from twenty years ago or if it’s the same Shariah—that’s the big question,” Rangina told me. “Shariah is not a book that you can pick up and say, ‘Here’s Shariah.’ It’s history and laws and regulations over 1,400 years, and it’s open to interpretation.”"

        "text": "The officials told her she no longer had a job at the ministry, but they asked her to stay in Afghanistan. They suggested she could help them by speaking to the media and telling the world they weren’t the monsters they were made out to be. Rangina was offended. “They just want me as their female spokesperson,” she said."

        "text": "As a former minister and U.S. citizen, Rangina had been prioritized for evacuation. As we talked, her phone rang, and she answered it. It was a marine, calling from the military base in Qatar. “If we can help you out, would you be willing to work with us to get through a gate in HKIA and get put on an airplane?”"

        "text": "The next day, her deputy, Attaullah Wahidyar, drove them in a truck to Glory Gate, with Zara sitting quietly beside her and Abdullah in the back seat. Rangina was racked with guilt over leaving; maybe if she stayed, the Taliban would be willing to listen to her. Wahidyar was certain she was making the right decision. “They would have used her,” he told me later. “You can’t say no to a Talib with a gun.”"

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "In the back of the pickup speeding toward the airport, Rangina wept as she remembered another journey she’d taken as a scared child more than thirty years ago. In the middle of the night, her father had taken the family and fled the communists in a truck like this one, and they’d become refugees. But now the little girl in the back seat was her own daughter, and she was sitting in her father’s place. And Ghulam Haider was dead, murdered, a martyr for the lost republic and the country she was leaving behind."

        "text": "A few days after the evacuation ended, I passed by the office of Etilaat-e Roz and was surprised to find Zaki still there. A couple of weeks earlier, he’d told me that he and his staff had decided to leave while they still had a chance to get out. But they hadn’t been able to get through the crowds at the airport. Zaki had been offered a place on our Sayara convoy, but he wasn’t willing to go without his colleagues."

        "text": "The Qataris, who were helping the Taliban get the airport running again, were still flying out some evacuees, so Zaki was hopeful that they could leave as a group in the coming days. A few of Zaki’s journalists were sitting around the office, looking depressed. They told me they hadn’t been out reporting yet; they were afraid of the Taliban on the street. I tried to reassure them by recounting how Mujahed, the spokesman, had given me a letter of permission and that I’d been able to keep working, even interview Taliban officials."
