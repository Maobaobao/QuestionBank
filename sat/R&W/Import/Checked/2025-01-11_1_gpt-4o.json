            "text": "In 1899 the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen introduced the concept of conspicuous consumption, or the flaunting of one’s wealth to gain status and recognition. New research finds a context in which people are better off holding back: when cooperation is at a premium."
          },

            "passage_number": 2,
            "text": "In the first of several online experiments, 303 participants from all over the world were recruited to play a variation of the Prisoner’s Dilemma— a game in which people can cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner for personal gain. Each was first shown an avatar supposedly designed by his or her partner. Half the avatars wore a shirt with a prominent logo of a luxury brand; the other half had shirts that were plain but otherwise identical. Just 45% of the participants whose partners had a status-signaling avatar played the game cooperatively, compared with 57% of those whose partners had a modestly dressed avatar."
          },
          {
            "passage_number": 3,
            "text": "The next experiment found the same pattern even when participants were allowed to dress an avatar of their own from a slate of outfits and chose clothing with a luxury brand. And when people were asked to evaluate 'John Thompson' for a cooperative social-media community, they were more likely to give him a thumbs-up when he had a modest profile than when he posted about luxury items or experiences."
          },
          {
            "passage_number": 4,
            "text": "Other experiments in the series suggest that people recognize the strategic value of modesty when they need to appear cooperative. For example, when asked to imagine that they wanted to join an online group and had to choose a profile picture that either included or omitted a luxury logo, just 27% of participants who were told that the group emphasized cooperation included the logo, compared with 43% of participants who weren’t told of that priority. 'Even though conspicuous consumption is a strategic behavior with assumed positive signal value… it also conveys a boastful self-interest, which is incompatible, in people’s minds, with prosociality,' the researchers write. 'Because prosociality is critical for cooperation, the signal value of conspicuous consumption flips from positive to negative in this situation.' These insights are especially important in the era of social media, they note, given how widely people can broadcast their consumption choices."
