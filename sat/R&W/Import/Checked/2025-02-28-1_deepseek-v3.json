        "passage_number": 1,
        "text": "The most common type of star-forming galaxy produces roughly one to tens of suns’ worth of stars a year. These are often called normal star-forming galaxies. The Milky Way is in this class. Normal star-forming galaxies are metaphorical tortoises, forming stars slowly and steadily over the course of ten billion years or so, remaining blue and disklike and depleting their reservoirs of fresh gas (fuel for new stars) at a leisurely pace."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Galaxies that produce hundreds to thousands of stars every year are known as starburst galaxies. These are the hares in galaxy evolution. In perhaps three hundred million years at most, these galaxies burst into existence, form as many stars as possible as quickly as possible and, in a cosmic blink of an eye, run out of fuel. Starbursts live fast and die young. Astronomers think that they are the best candidate ancestors for the massive, dead elliptical galaxies we see in clusters today."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "It stands to reason that if we looked deep enough into space, we would find protoclusters filled with starburst galaxies—tomorrow’s clusters of dead galaxies. Yet finding starburst galaxies in protoclusters has proved challenging. Until recently, most of our methods for spotting clusters were developed to preferentially select dying elliptical galaxies or the hot gas that pervades the space between them. Elliptical galaxies and hot intracluster gas appear at the later stages of galaxy cluster evolution, so we need new methods to find their bluer, more star-forming infant counterparts."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "To make things more difficult, protoclusters are often spread far apart on the sky because the galaxies have yet to fully coalesce into the dense structures we see today. When our most famous and precise telescopes have cameras that span only the width of a pencil (the Hubble Space Telescope, for instance), it is not surprising that we cannot piece together protocluster puzzle pieces that are spread across the sky at distances more than 100 times greater than our telescope’s field of view."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "Other methods of searching, such as systematically surveying large swaths of the sky, tend to miss starburst galaxies because they are often obscured by dust. The exceptional stellar growth in starbursts generates an overabundance of heavy metals that are produced in the explosive deaths of stars. Once dispersed into space, heavy elements such as iron, carbon, and gold collide to form complex dust molecules that absorb and obscure ultraviolet and optical light. Think of the reddening sun during wildfire season: dust dims hotter, more energetic blue light while letting redder light sneak through. The result is that starburst galaxies are nearly invisible when viewed with optical and ultraviolet telescopes, but they shine like beacons when viewed in the cooler infrared spectrum."

      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "All of this means that until recently, the tools to find and study protoclusters usually missed a key population of galaxies. From the late 1990s through the early 2010s, the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array, the Herschel Space Observatory, the South Pole Telescope, and the Spitzer Space Telescope revolutionized our understanding of the dust-obscured universe by unveiling millions of galaxies that were previously invisible. Starting about fifteen years ago, astronomers began studying the clustering properties of dusty starbursts, and they found that these powerhouses live preferentially near other large and actively star-forming galaxies."

      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "But the state of technology was still behind our ambitions; the resolution of infrared and millimeter telescopes was still so low that multiple galaxies would get blended into one large object, even if those galaxies were far apart but lay along the same line of sight. The age of the infrared universe was here, but we needed sharper and more sensitive instruments to fully comprehend what we were seeing."

      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Finally, in 2013, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) arrived. High in the Chilean desert, this collection of nearly seventy radio dishes works together as a single telescope, reaching resolutions up to six hundred times sharper than that of the Herschel telescope. ALMA has transformed many corners of astronomy, including galaxy evolution. (I know several people with tattoos dedicated to this telescope.) The observatory is excellent at detecting dusty, gaseous stellar nurseries throughout star-forming galaxies. With it, astronomers have discovered systems that are both shocking and exciting."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "In 2018 two separate teams of astronomers used ALMA to study the brightest infrared objects they could find in the distant universe. Each team discovered a different conglomeration of dusty, starbursting galaxies that were previously blended together, hiding as one in surveys taken by the first generation of infrared telescopes. SPT2349-56, a group of fourteen galaxies, and the Distant Red Core (DRC), a group of ten galaxies, were both found growing and thriving in different corners of the universe, when the cosmos was only 10 percent of its current age. We see both these budding protoclusters undergoing extreme bursts of star formation—each group birthing nearly ten thousand times as much stellar mass a year as the Milky Way does—across volumes only half the size of our Local Group (which includes our own galaxy plus Andromeda and several smaller galaxies). Estimates of the protoclusters’ individual gas reservoirs tell us that if these galaxies continued to form stars at such excessive rates, they would exhaust their fuel supply in just a few hundred million years and become the massive red-and-dead elliptical galaxies that are ubiquitous in fully grown clusters. Moreover, they would complete this cycle well before the present era."

        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "The discovery of these two dust-obscured protocluster cores presented a promising new lens for studying cluster growth, but we were still missing an important part of the picture. The best way to “weigh” a galaxy is to measure the light from its adult star population, which requires data from across the electromagnetic spectrum. But until recently, all observations of protoclusters living in the first two billion years of the universe had been conducted within a narrow energy spectrum (in either the optical or the infrared). Then, in September 2018, my colleagues and I were able to observe, for the first time, ultraviolet and optical emission from a dusty, starbursting protocluster as seen twelve billion years ago: the Distant Red Core. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the Gemini Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we captured the multiwavelength perspective necessary to more deeply understand this structure’s past and future."
