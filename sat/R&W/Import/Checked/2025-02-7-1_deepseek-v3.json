        "text": "In my luggage I found a bus ticket, so I took a taxicab to the bus. The driver knew the general direction of the bus depot but was always forgetting the streets that led there. That was what he told me. Everything was in the process of being built or being demolished, and the constant construction meant that as soon as storefronts, street vendors, and corner buildings became recognizable, they were replaced with other storefronts, street vendors, and corner buildings that were destined to become something other than what they were."

        "text": "The taxicab driver was a handsome young guy in his twenties. I asked him about his experience of the economy. He told me he had just returned to work from a strike. Fuel was taxed to such an extent that no one could afford to drive. Some people could afford to drive, but they weren’t taxicab drivers or the people who hired them, so from his perspective, no one could afford it. The drivers liked to talk to one another at taxicab depots. One day, they agreed to strike the following week. They parked their taxicabs in the middle of the city’s busiest intersection, so that even the people who could afford fuel were obstructed from using their vehicles. No one could go anywhere, but people didn’t mind, because once they became stuck, the taxicab drivers provided them with everything they needed. Supply trucks bringing vegetables to the city’s markets relinquished their stock of corn, which the taxicab drivers roasted over coals and gave out for free."

        "text": "At first, the government did not respond to the action. The highest officials were transported via helicopter. From above, the traffic jam looked like it might, in time, disperse. But the stoppage did not clear. Taxicab drivers from neighboring regions heard about the strike and left their families to join it. To them, the price of fuel felt even higher, given that they had fewer customers and the same expenses.<br>The highest officials instructed the middle officials to shut off the internet, which didn’t matter, because only a small portion of the population used it (in this taxicab driver’s estimation, 3 percent). The lowest officials (the police) surrounded the drivers, their taxicabs, and all the cars that had gotten stuck between them. The police shot one taxicab driver and his child, who had nothing to do with it. The child died, and then the highest officials made a special announcement. They were happy to report that the country was in a financially strong position, and thus would be able to reduce fuel tariffs by one percentage point. They thanked the people for their continued support, and then they helicoptered away."

        "text": "The taxicab driver’s story made me feel confused. On the one hand the action was successful, and would improve the lives of all taxicab drivers. On the other hand, a child, who wasn’t a taxicab driver but was nevertheless related to one, had died. I hadn’t expected to hear such a complicated story from a random taxicab driver, but that’s how life was for taxicab drivers, as I had learned when I started working as a taxicab driver in the country where I had become a citizen. That was what I told this taxicab driver. He seemed skeptical about that. From what he had heard, he said, taxicab drivers in the country where I had become a citizen had the opportunity to grow extremely wealthy, given that the economy was historically robust, even if it was currently having some problems. Theoretically, I admitted, taxicab drivers in the country where I had become a citizen had a regular clientele, and even if they didn’t, they could borrow money from the bank, purchase a medallion, and eventually make a huge amount of income without having to drive anywhere, given that the value of taxicab medallions was guaranteed to increase exponentially as time went on. However, in my experience, even a guarantee was unreliable, as anything could happen between the present and the future, including death."
