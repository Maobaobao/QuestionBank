        "text": "At home Mother okayed my proposition as I knew she would and brought out extra sheets. And I made his bed, next to mine on the floor. Salim wanted to shower. I opened the bathroom for him and pressed a towel in his hands. I felt my sex grow. I tucked my hardness between my legs and hoped it wouldn’t show through my underwear. Salim came back from the bathroom in a towel, naked from the waist up. His body emanated heat, but it was my face that felt warm as I hovered around him, asking if he needed another towel. He had hair all over his chest, a mole on his biceps. I had one in the exact same place and I showed him."

        "text": "I touched his mole, pushing it with my index finger. “Oh, it is a mole,” I said, keeping my face straight. “What did you think it was?” he laughed. I gave him one of Father’s tee shirts and ran to the bathroom. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I went to the bathroom and pulled out my fly. The scent of him lingered and I stood there inhaling it, watching myself grow. The tap was wet, Salim had been naked right in front of it. I moved to touch the tap. The long handle of the tap could have been his shaft and I stroked it again and again, bathing in the scent he left. I perched down and took it in my mouth and cocked my head back and forth, imagining him scrunching his face, and I knew this was wrong, something was very wrong with me, but I could not stop, and with each hold of my mouth, I felt my penis grow harder and harder, and I held my hand to the hardness while I continued to move my tongue over the tip of the handle, licking it in each untouched spot, teasing it, and I closed my mouth around it, working against the handle faster and faster till I came."

        "text": "By the time I cleaned up and came back, he was fast asleep. I fell on my mattress and lay awake for a long time, torn between wanting to wrap myself around Salim and running away that very night before I got outed. When I finally fell asleep and woke up the next morning, Salim had already left, and Mother was searching the house, turning up plastic chairs."

        "text": "Mother asked me if I had taken the twenty rupees she had placed in the folds of a magazine that had been on the teapoy. I hadn’t, but I felt my stomach tighten, and I saw the same thought cross her eyes. Had Salim stolen the money? I asked if she had kept the money elsewhere and forgotten. And she accepted that as a possibility. But I left for school wishing I could make the money appear. I would somehow detect that the wind had swept the note to a corner. Or Mother would remember where she misplaced the money. Anything really. I knew Salim had money problems—I paid for everything. But I thought he’d ask if he needed the money. I sat through the class with difficulty and returned home."

        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "Mother said she hadn’t found the money. I dropped my bag and went looking for him. I figured I’d ask him casually if he happened to see any money lying on the ground that night. I went to his house. The gate was locked. I didn’t see him the whole week. Mother forgot about the money. Every day after school, I did the circuit. I went to the playground, the theater, the market, the adda. I spun my globe, wondering where he was. I lost interest in school. No one asked me to teach English anymore; no one squeezed my wrist as he did. Each day I looked for him, the money became less and less important. And I slapped my thighs in anger. What I had done with the tap, my sin, had pushed him away. In the bathroom, I remembered what I had done, and my penis began to expand. I was ashamed; I took a blade, steadied my hand, and put a tiny cut. A drop of blood emerged, and the sight of it stopped my shame. I apologized to him at all the places, for desiring him, for doubting him."

        "text": "The next week, I came home from school and saw him sitting on the sofa laughing with Mother, as if they were now best friends, as if she were just as important in his coming to our house. I went straight to my room and collapsed by the window. Salim came into the room and put his hand on my shoulder. He whispered sorry, and I felt his mouth brush against my ear. A tingly warmth spread through my body."

        "text": "“I had to go to my father’s village on an urgent matter,” Salim said. “What happened?” I asked, continuing to act upset. “My father began drinking again; we had to take him. He can drink all the buffalo milk he gets there.” He grinned. In spite of myself, I let out a chuckle. “I looked for you everywhere,” I said. “Sorry,” he repeated and enveloped me with his long arms. I turned and hugged him. Locked in his embrace, I looked outside the window. A pigeon lay on the neighbor’s wall looking for grains. He held me tighter. The pigeon found a grain a couple of feet away on the wall. His hands caressed my back. The pigeon hopped to the grain. He kissed me on the cheek. The pigeon grabbed the grain and flew—not knowing that it lifted into the sky my soul."

        "text": "Most days, I found Salim at home eating Mother’s pakoras, regaling her with all sorts of tales. He’d say that he’d marry a woman like her, making her blush and laugh in a way I’d never seen before, and then he’d turn to me and wink. This only meant I didn’t have to explain who we were. I could linger in the painting that was Two Boys on a Terrace. January brought my fourteenth birthday. We bought a bubble stick, for laughs, something we both had done when we were much younger, and rinsed it with soap and blew soap bubbles at each other, often grazing each other’s feet. We hadn’t proceeded beyond what we already did. I hadn’t asked if his kiss on the cheek meant more than the affection men sometimes displayed in Bollywood movies. There was time, we’d get there. But I found myself growing in confidence, and I threw away the blade in the bathroom."

        "text": "Mother baked a cake and gave us money to officially watch a movie. We went to the theater, this time unafraid. Salim copied the gestures of film stars and I copied him. I cupped my palms when I spoke in a low voice, like him. I drank chai in the evening, like him. How was I to know things would change so soon?"

        "text": "Chacha beckoned me the day after my birthday and asked me what Salim’s name was. He had seen him around the house often and wanted to know who he was. He knew Salim was Muslim, and this was his way of confirming. Fucking pig. “Samir,” I said and ran. February followed. Father would return any day—it was time. Dark clouds of rain lurched forward in the sky. Shadows the size of mountains cast gloom everywhere. Vendors in the vegetable market packed up their carts in a hurry. The ice cream vendor was nowhere. The playground was desolate. The cinema had a padlock—temporarily closed for projector repair. I found Salim sitting on the train tracks, throwing pebbles at the track. “It’s only temporary,” I said. But I couldn’t hide the fear in my voice; it felt like we were train tracks, parallel lines that cannot meet. Chacha would tell Father, and he wouldn’t let us meet. Salim stared at the tracks. “I’m leaving for Bombay,” he said. Every pebble thrown at the track made a dull cracking noise I heard again and again. “When?” I asked. The rumble of clouds silenced everything. “Soon, I’ll come say bye. In a couple of days,” he said. I wanted to leave with him; I had fantasized about running away with Salim. He’d tell me to come to the train station one day. I’d hurry there, forgetting to pack my prized globe. And he’d offer to get it for me. And I’d tell him that I wouldn’t need it anymore. And that he was my world. But he hadn’t asked me to come with him, and I had too much pride to ask. Salim stood up and brushed the dirt from his pants. “There’s nothing here. I have to go,” he said. I let out a sob. “I’ll come with you,” I said. Salim squeezed me on the shoulder and left. I broke away to the terrace and stared at the Karimnagar-sized nothingness in front of me. I blew soap bubbles alone on the terrace. And I could not think of anything other than the one time Salim and I blew soap bubbles at each other. There were things we wanted to do together. Swimming lessons that never happened. Cricket coaching sessions that got postponed. The trip to his village that never materialized. There were conversations that needed to be had. I wanted to know what his mother was like. What did he do when his father drank, and he was too young? Why did he prefer full-sleeve shirts instead of half-sleeve shirts? What were his childhood stories? What had he done when he was fourteen? Why did he have to use his fingers to push up his hair after he had used a comb? Had he liked me the way I liked him? The soap bubbles lifted higher and floated away. Through them, some things were enlarged, and some were minimized. I saw Salim’s absence looming large, and Salim himself in the distance, shrinking away. The bubbles, it struck me, were like memories; they were not original events themselves, they were illusions. And what could I do—I wept on the terrace—but touch these bubbles and hear them go pop pop pop!"
