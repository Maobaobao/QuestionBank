    {
      "passage_number": 1,
      "text": "By the time the Kyoto Protocol was ratified, in 2005, MyClimate was financing significant climate-action projects, including an initiative to supply clean electricity to a hundred Indian villages; it soon won a contract to compensate for emissions from the FIFA World Cup in Germany. The founders were still operating on a tiny budget, yet, as the UN’s carbon-trading system got under way, they saw new possibilities. In a multibillion-dollar market, perhaps the profit motive would be the most effective way to spur action. 'Capitalism works very efficiently,' Heuberger said. 'The idea that you could actually make money is a massive driver.' The following year, he and Bürgi left their student venture behind and registered a company with three other friends, with a maxim of 'profit for purpose.'"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "The new business would focus on cultivating projects to sell credits through the UN system. The name, South Pole, referred both to Antarctica’s melting ice caps and to the Global South, where most of its projects would be based. Heuberger borrowed twenty thousand francs from his parents for his stake in the business, and the entrepreneurs secured a workspace: a disused university chemistry lab, with long banks of sinks and cannisters of nitrogen that clients sometimes mistook for sequestered carbon. In the summer, they took breaks to swim in the Limmat, and in the winter they skied together."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "Their first breakthrough came easily. China had just announced a five-year plan for renewable energy, and developers of wind, solar, and hydropower plants were gathering for the country’s first Carbon Expo. Heuberger called a backpacking buddy who spoke Chinese and asked him to meet in Beijing. They printed business cards with a penguin logo, and scheduled meetings with developers in the lobbies of five-star hotels, though they were sleeping in a youth hostel."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "South Pole’s pitch was simple: it would help developers sell credits based on the carbon that would have been emitted if the power they produced had instead come from fossil fuels. The income would be small compared with what they made selling electricity, but it would come at no cost; South Pole would take care of all the complex carbon accounting, in exchange for a commission."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 5,
      "text": "Heuberger’s meetings at the conference led to several large projects, including a sprawling network of hydropower plants in the mountains of southwest China. After that, the company expanded rapidly. The founders scattered across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, signing up hundreds more projects. Soon, South Pole had opened branches in Thailand, Mexico, Indonesia, and India. Staffers, who came to be known as 'penguins,' greeted new employees with cries of 'Welcome to the iceberg!'"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 6,
      "text": "In the years after the Kyoto targets came into effect, thousands of projects were registered under the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism, and hundreds of millions of credits were issued, each worth one metric ton of carbon. Yet, as the market grew, so did questions about its integrity. Scholars worried that developers would inflate their projects’ climate impact. Many environmentalists dismissed offsetting as a system of empty indulgences. One online spoof invited unfaithful spouses to pay someone else to remain faithful: 'By paying Cheat Neutral, you’re funding monogamy-boosting offset projects.'"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 7,
      "text": "At parties in Zurich, South Pole’s founders were grilled about the ethics of the carbon trade. 'We were constantly challenged by friends,' Bürgi told me. But Heuberger brushed aside such concerns. If humanity was to have any chance of saving itself, he was convinced, 'there must be a positive narrative to climate action.' When skeptics disagreed, he told me, his reaction was 'Shut up. Keep it to yourself. Because we are on a mission here.'"

    {
      "passage_number": 8,
      "text": "In 2009, South Pole attracted its first major investment, from BP. An executive in the oil company’s alternative-energy division, Justin Adams, took a seat on South Pole’s board, and made a close study of Heuberger. 'Renat’s a complex character, who I think is extremely strategic and thoughtful about how you can give people some hope in a time of fear,' he told me. 'But I suspect, like so many of us, there are deeper shadows in our own psyches. He had all the makings of a little emperor, and he’s incredibly tough.'"
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 9,
      "text": "The association with a major oil company didn’t trouble Heuberger. 'We can talk to the biggest boys in the world,' he said. With the market flourishing, he became increasingly focused on maximizing revenue. 'I want to spin a big wheel,' he told me. 'With more money we can have more impact. We can do better, bigger things.'"

    {
      "passage_number": 10,
      "text": "One day in 2010, an e-mail from Steve Wentzel, the Zimbabwean tycoon, arrived in the in-box of one of South Pole’s founders—a tall, bluff German man named Christian Dannecker. It invited the company to enter new territory.<br><br>Wentzel ran a business in Guernsey that promised to 'provide financial liberty through modern offshore financial services,' as well as a money-lending enterprise based in Mauritius. He had recently acquired a parcel of woodland from a debtor who had failed to repay a large loan."
