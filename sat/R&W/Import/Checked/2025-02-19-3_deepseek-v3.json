        "text": "Just by dint of ending up in our hands, Victory City vindicates Pampa’s bittersweet faith in literature. In a sense, that’s true of everything Rushdie has published since 1989, when he went into hiding after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran, issued a fatwa, a religious ruling, in this case condemning Rushdie to death. His books could so easily not have been written. But Victory City is especially precious. For one thing, it comes out a mere six months after a self-avowed admirer of Khomeini finally got to Rushdie, assaulting him on a stage and stabbing him repeatedly in the neck and torso. Rushdie lost the use of an eye and a hand. He may have still been working on this novel; he may have finished it already. Readers will easily spot general parallels between our hero and her creator—both are prolific world-builders; both must elude political assassination—but a few of them seem to reproduce with eerie specificity the events of the summer. We don’t know whether he added those afterward or life imitated fiction, as it sometimes does. It doesn’t matter. What’s important is that Victory City is a triumph— not because it exists, but because it is utterly enchanting. Words are the only victors."

        "text": "If this somber backstory makes you think that the novel is a slog, I’ve misled you. Victory City is a cheerful little vessel, despite its ultimate destination. Its myths of origin are recounted with glee. The day Bisnaga is created, its newly minted inhabitants are found asleep in the street, or wandering like sleepwalkers, or rolling on the ground in a state of confusion, beshitting themselves. Pampa whispers words that reach their ears and fill their minds with fictional ancestors, made-up memories, and notions of how to behave. By the following day, the adults are acting like adults and the children are running around as children should. Out of chaos has come something very like a nation: 'It was as if everyone had lived here for years,' Rushdie writes, and had 'formed a longestablished community, a city of love and death, tears and laughter, loyalty and betrayal, and everything else that human nature contains.'"

        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "Rushdie plays adroitly with the metafictional and political implications of 'real' people and a 'real' polity being created out of imaginary backstories. (The image brings to mind a line from Benedict Anderson’s great treatise on nationalism, Imagined Communities : 'It is the magic of nationalism to turn chance into destiny.') But not to worry. These big ideas bob along on the novel’s buoyant tone. That is set by two former cowherds, Hukka and Bukka, who hail from a town named Gooty. Fresh from a stint of inept soldiering and inspired by word of Pampa’s great beauty, they show up at her door bearing a bag of seeds, among other gifts. She casts a spell on the seeds and sends the young men out to sow them. Stunned to see the city materialize, Hukka and Bukka decide that one of them should be its king and the other the king in waiting. That they’re the right men for the jobs is not immediately evident."

        "text": "'We must become gods now,' Hukka says. 'There, you see,' he says, pointing. 'There is our father, the Moon.' Oh, cut it out, Bukka says. 'We’ll never get away with that.' A little later, it’s Bukka’s turn to essay great thoughts. 'What is a human being?' he ventures. Did we start out as seeds? Or vegetables? Or 'cows who lost our udders and two of our legs'? Frankly, he says, 'I’m finding the vegetable possibility the most upsetting. I don’t want to discover that my greatgrandfather was a brinjal, or a pea.'"

        "text": "Soon enough, they’ve moved on to the topic of who will be king first.<br><br>'Well,' Bukka said, hopefully, 'I’m the smartest.' 'That’s debatable,' Hukka said. 'However, I’m the oldest.' 'And I’m the most likable.' 'Again, debatable. But I repeat: I’m the oldest.' 'Yes, you’re old. But I’m the most dynamic.' 'Dynamic isn’t the same thing as regal,' Hukka said. 'And I’m still the oldest.'"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "If their shtick sounds familiar, that’s because Hukka and Bukka descend from a noble line of squabbling clowns. They’re the heirs of the Marx Brothers bumbling around Freedonia; Abbott and Costello debating who’s on first; The Lion King’s Timon and Pumbaa arguing over which bugs taste best. You can’t read this novel without having classic movies on the brain. Film references are everywhere. Hukka insults his and Bukka’s no-good, thieving brothers, Pukka, Chukka."
