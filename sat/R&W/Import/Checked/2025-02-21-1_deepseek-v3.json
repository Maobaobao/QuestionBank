        "text": "Big Basin is California’s oldest operating state park, and the model for the rest. Established in 1902 in response to clear-cutting of redwoods, it became a place where people could commune with the 300-foot-tall giants, and with each other. The park’s built footprint grew with its popularity; during the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps erected a lodge, cabins, an amphitheater, and more structures."

        "text": "As trees fell outside its boundaries, Big Basin and other protected forests, including neighboring Portola and Butano state parks, became sanctuaries for the murrelet—although people didn’t yet know it. The bird was an enigma. Ornithologists had little clue where it nested until loggers in British Columbia began finding chicks and eggs among felled trees in the 1950s and ’60s. Then, in 1974, a tree pruner working high in a Douglas fir in Big Basin nearly stepped on a downy chick hunkered on a branch 150 feet off the ground. He had found the first recorded tree nest for the species."

        "text": "Captivated by the murrelet’s story, a federal soil conservationist named Steve Singer began devoting much of his free time to studying the birds and became a local expert and consultant. Working with graduate student Nancy Naslund in the late 1980s, and later with the Santa Cruz Bird Club, he and his wife, Stephanie Singer, spent weekends spying on trees in Big Basin that murrelets might favor, discovering a handful of nests. But while monitoring nests provided insight on murrelet natural history, they were too well hidden, scattered, and high up to study in a practical way. So, in the ’90s, state park staff launched audiovisual surveys, sending biologists to watch and listen for murrelets at specific inland study sites over a set time frame. Steve Singer helped lead them."

      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "The findings suggested that Big Basin was the Santa Cruz Mountains’ most hopping murrelet breeding ground. The birds were so dense around a study site near park headquarters, called Redwood Meadow, that surveyors sometimes logged as many as three hundred “detections,” such as sightings or calls, in a morning. But the counts also revealed that the meadow’s murrelets were declining, and by 2005 detections plunged to around eight on average."

        "text": "It was hard to be sure why, but there was one compelling possibility. Years earlier, Naslund had filmed two Steller’s Jays flank a murrelet chick and tear it apart in its nest. “They basically double-teamed him,” Singer says. Meanwhile, Common Ravens had been on the rise in the Santa Cruz Mountains since the 1980s. Of the twenty murrelet nests discovered there, predators had raided at least seven, and possibly nine more. Corvids plucked offspring from at least four nests."

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "When researchers looked more closely, they found Steller’s Jays were as many as nine times more abundant near campgrounds in the Santa Cruz Mountains than they were in surrounding forest. Ravens were twenty-eight times more common. It made sense: Campgrounds meant accessible human food. Further studies showed that jays gorging on campers’ leavings were healthier than their wilder counterparts and had more babies, most of which dispersed into murrelet habitat. And at Big Basin, some two hundred campsites crowded in and around the murrelets’ favored old-growth core, along with picnic areas, parking lots, a museum, and other busy facilities—all near Redwood Meadow."

        "text": "Changing the park layout would have been politically unpopular and financially difficult. So, in 2012, Portia Halbert started the “Keep It Crumb Clean Campaign.” It required campers to watch a video explaining the dangers of unattended food, garbage, and scraps and sign a “Crumb Clean Commitment,” backed by fines. Signs and animal-proof food lockers went up at campgrounds, along with dishwashing kiosks and special grates beneath water spigots that kept food bits from accumulating on the ground. To supplement these efforts, park staff also killed some ravens with air rifles. It seemed to be effective: By 2020, corvid numbers in campgrounds had dropped and Big Basin’s murrelet numbers were rebounding slightly."

        "text": "Then the CZU Fire hit. As soon as it was safe, Singer visited some good nesting trees he had mapped before the blaze. Of eighteen suitable redwoods, fifteen had survived and still seemed worthy nest sites. All but seven of twenty-two Douglas firs died. Extrapolating across the burned parts of known murrelet areas, Singer estimated the birds lost 33 percent of their nesting grounds. “It couldn’t have occurred at a worse spot in the Santa Cruz Mountains,” he says. And for Singer, it begged the question: Would this event push the birds over the edge?"

        "text": "Summer is a sleepless season for people who study birds. The weekly audiovisual survey starts forty-five minutes before sunrise; on July 8, 2021, that’s 5:12 a.m. Halbert has been up for two hours when she begins to scan the sky at her site, a dirt lot surrounded by thick forest in Portola Redwoods State Park, just north of Big Basin. The first sounds are the yelling of an American Robin and the laugh track of Acorn Woodpeckers. Then a high, clear note cuts through the marine fog above: keer."

        "text": "“There!” Halbert says. She notes into her tape recorder a murrelet bound inland, as she will all other murrelet activity she witnesses over the next two hours. Surveyors at three other state parks in the Santa Cruz Mountains will do the same.<br><br>There is lots to listen for besides keers. A groan call that is a cross between a creaking door and a kazoo. The WHUF-whuf-whuf of wingbeats under the canopy, a sign of a nest nearby. Soon, murrelets are traversing the gap of sky above our heads in pairs and groups, constellations of flight and song. Social hour, Halbert calls it."
