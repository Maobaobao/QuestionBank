        "passage_number": 1,
        "text": "At most companies with which the Good Jobs Institute has worked, employers poured the equivalent of 10% to 25% of their labor budget into replacement costs—the costs to recruit, train, and reach baseline productivity, only to start all over again when employees leave. But those costs pale in comparison with costs from the inevitable poor operational execution that takes place when there is high turnover: lower sales from mistakes, slow service, and customer dissatisfaction; higher product costs from more errors, overtime, and reduced labor productivity."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "High turnover also hurts company performance. Managers are always fighting fires, never having enough time to hire and train well. Inevitably, these companies don’t trust their frontliners to do a good job, and they design the jobs for interchangeable pairs of hands rather than humans with brains, wasting so much talent and potential along the way. Understaffing is common, which causes even more problems and creates anxiety for employees and their managers. Overworked managers then leave or ask to be demoted. Expectations become dismally low."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "High turnover is not just expensive. It’s ruinous. And a system based on low pay and high turnover is a weak match for what’s coming. With more retirements, it’s not going to get any easier to hire and retain frontline workers. A leaked Amazon memo from 2022 revealed that the company had to change its expansion plans because, given its high turnover rate, it would simply run out of people within a few years. With frontline employees in high demand and new minimum-wage regulations, continuously rising wages are inevitable, and companies will face increasing costs for the same output."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "The good news: companies can change. Walmart’s Sam’s Club, call centers at Quest Diagnostics, and petstore chain Mud Bay improved pay and schedules, and redesigned their systems to improve productivity and service. In 2019, Sam’s Club increased pay by $5 to $7 an hour for several key roles and, from 2020 to 2022, further increased hourly pay for all employees by 18%. In 2016, Quest Diagnostics raised starting pay for its callcenter workers from $13 to $14 and implemented tenure-based increases. Mud Bay, a chain with 2% profit margins, increased hourly pay 24% over three years. By 2022, it was able to pay all its employees a living wage, according to MIT’s living-wage calculator. These companies didn’t just raise pay, they made employees’ work more valuable, making the pay investment worthy."

      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "So, what were the results? Within two years, Sam’s Club reduced hourly workers’ turnover by 25%. Manager turnover dropped even more. Within 18 months, Quest Diagnostics reduced hourly turnover by more than 50%, and absenteeism dropped. Within three years, Mud Bay reduced turnover by 35%.<br><br>In addition to lower turnover costs, all these companies saw higher sales and improved productivity. At Sam’s Club, productivity increased 16%, customer loyalty increased 7%, and sales grew nearly 15% without opening any new stores. At Quest, overall costs decreased $2 million, $1.3 million of which came from ideas from the reps. Customers received better service, with fewer transfers and faster answer rates. At Mud Bay, employees were able to generate 12% higher sales per labor hour and 25% higher sales per sq. ft. (compared with an average 9% increase for the industry at the time). We’ve seen similar results in small restaurants and bakeries."

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Leaders at these companies realized that to win with their customers and grow, they couldn’t afford high employee turnover. Instead of asking, “How much will it cost to increase pay?” they asked a more enlightened question: “What will be the cost to my competitors if we get this right, and they don’t?”"
