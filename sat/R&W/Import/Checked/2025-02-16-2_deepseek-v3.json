        "text": "My first night on the island was May 22, 2003—eighteen years to the day before Bull and Clemans found that dead turtle. I had studied the reptiles before, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but became much more adept at deciphering what stage of nesting they were in. When nesting, female turtles make sand pits a foot or two deep, then carefully scoop sand with their hind flippers to make chambers for their eggs. Once a turtle lays about 100 eggs, she pats sand gently over them and then throws sand with her front flippers to disguise the nest under a mound. I often witnessed mothers showing incredible tenacity; some had entire flippers bitten off by tiger sharks, and others exhibited fresh wounds with bones extending out. But the turtles didn’t let the injuries stop them from digging, sometimes all night."

        "text": "My work required tenacity, too. I walked through so much soft sand over the summer and squatted and crouched and crawled so much that I lost close to 20 pounds, despite treating every day like a carb party. The duties often ran straight through the night, so I took short food breaks, drinking cold cans of soup and chili. I made coffee doused with chocolate syrup and ate packages of Chips Ahoy! and Oreos."

        "text": "Life and death packed every day. Fledgling birds flew off the island at dawn. Sometimes, they dropped in the surf just feet away from where I stood, and ten-foot-long tiger sharks jumped out of the shallows to eat them. When sea turtles crawled ashore at night to dig holes and lay their eggs, they might crush the eggs of ground-nesting seabirds or collapse the homes of burrow-nesting seabirds. Male seals cruised along the shoreline for mates. Females gave birth to their pups on the beach, leaving their placentas in the sand. Blood and sex and splattered yolks were the norm."

        "text": "“The trash here is crazy,” reported my journal entry from my first night on East. Washed-up nets, bottles, buoys, fishing line and broken, weathered, colorful bits of plastic lined the shore. The plastic nets and line posed a significant threat to the turtles and seals, who could easily become entangled in them and die. Since 1982, scientists have documented more than 300 entanglement incidents of Hawaiian monk seals, of which only 1,500 or so remain in the wild. Many more instances likely go undetected. Globally, at least 354 different species have been found in similarly entangled states."

        "text": "On my dusk walks around the island, I played my part to make a dent, collecting debris and piling it near my camp for later removal. But the trash didn’t just wash ashore. It came by air, too. Once, while I was walking on Tern’s runway with a seabird biologist, we came across a dark brown mass of crud about the size of a child’s drinking cup. Frans Juola, the researcher, explained that black-footed and Laysan albatross chicks, seabirds with wingspans stretching more than six feet, sometimes regurgitated their stomach contents to get rid of undigestible bits."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "As Juola looked at this bolus, as the mass is called, he found bits of plastic and a roughly three-inch-long hook, thick as a chick’s neck, with a metal line attached. A parent had swallowed the hook while at sea, then flown home to this island and regurgitated the sharp object to its chick, along with the debris. The chick, in turn, had coughed it up. Not all chicks were able to rid their stomachs of foreign objects. They often died, and amid their bones were the large, colorful clumps of weathered plastic—lighters, bottle caps, fishing line—that filled their stomachs. Scientists studying the chicks in Hawaii in the 1980s found that 90 percent of them already had plastics in their guts. The problem has gotten more severe, and scientists estimate that 99 percent of all seabird species will ingest plastics by 2050."

        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "Though the plastic brought me down, so many natural events surprised me that first year. When snorkeling off Tern and around the refuge, I spied large, three-foot-long fish called jacks; whitetip reef sharks; eels; and, among the corals, loads of small, colorful creatures, from squirrelfish to nudibranchs. On East, a molting monk seal smelled worse than sweaty, pungent gym socks. A brown noddy landed on my head and performed a tap dance. Sea turtles threw sand into any exposed crevice in my body. Floating albatross feathers, the aftermath of attacks by sharks, stuck to my skin as I emerged from the ocean after a bath. Slimy guano bombs from birds smacked my head and back."

      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Both East and Tern were packed with wildlife that migrated away in summer and fall. On East, the turtles dug so many nests that by the end of the summer the island looked like a mogul run. Their hatchlings erupted out of the sand by the hundreds at night. On Tern, tens of thousands of seabird chicks sat less than a foot apart from each other on the ground, just waiting to lose their down and take to the skies."

        "text": "By the end of the season, my sugar-fueled work had helped identify more than 200 nesting turtles, a big uptick from the sixty-seven that had been found nesting on the island in 1973. The government’s 1978 listing of the green sea turtle under the Endangered Species Act had helped, though the animals were far from recovered and retained their “threatened species” status. When I had time, I helped turtles whose hind flippers had been bitten off by sharks by digging nests for them. Turtles became entangled in copper wire left in the ground by the Coast Guard, who had used East as a long-range navigation station in the 1940s and 1950s. I cut the animals free and pulled up the metal."

        "text": "After spending four consecutive research seasons on Tern and East Islands, I was away from 2007 to 2012, having taken a job at Outside magazine before writing as a freelance journalist. In July 2013, I made two brief pit stops by ship to Lalo to check sea turtle nesting on its islands.<br>Though Tern had been falling apart since the 1970s, many damages had been mitigated by USFWS staff. But in December 2012, a powerful storm hit the island. Damaging winds, possibly over 100 miles per hour, destroyed the boat shed and tore the walls off the barracks before generating enough flying debris to kill or injure more than 200 birds, of which many had to be euthanized. Nine days after the storm, the staff were rescued. Tern would not host scientists year-round again. Dedicated biological surveys that had spanned decades stopped. Buildings fell apart. Walks to look for entrapped animals ended."
