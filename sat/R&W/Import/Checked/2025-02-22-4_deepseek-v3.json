        "text": "Titan Cave is about a hundred miles from Yellowstone National Park, where, a couple of weeks after our expedition, rain and snowmelt inundated the landscape. Rivers and tributaries demolished previous high-water records; one spot on the Yellowstone—the site the US Geological Survey calls Yellowstone River at Corwin Springs—peaked at 13.88 feet, more than two feet higher than the previous record, set in 1918. The flooding decimated roads and bridges, washed buildings into rivers and broke water mains. The National Park Service temporarily closed the park and ordered more than ten thousand visitors to leave."

      {
        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Climate change is intensifying weather: Dry periods are drier, wet periods are wetter, and human infrastructure and communities are not, in most places, prepared for it. By the end of this century, the area around Yellowstone is expected to be more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was between 1986 and 2005, and to experience 9 percent more precipitation—but lose 40 percent of the average snowpack. That means more rain, and more floods."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "Scientists make these projections using climate models. The models are based on physics: For example, warmer air can hold more moisture than cooler air. This is one reason why, as climate change ratchets up temperatures, storms are becoming more extreme."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "Researchers can use information about the past—paleoclimate data—to test how well the models are working. This gives them more confidence in their projections: They can plug certain conditions into the models—like how much of the earth was covered by glaciers or ice sheets, the sea level, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere—and then see whether the models return temperature and rainfall patterns that match what actually happened."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "“We’re pinning our faith on these models to deliver accurate projections,” Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and the director of Brown University’s Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, said. “And this is one of the most important ways we have of understanding their limitations and their strengths.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "This testing, however, requires knowledge of what happened in the past. There are two kinds of historical data: instrumental data and proxy data. Instrumental data comes from direct measurements made with a thermometer, a rain gauge, or another instrument. But the era of direct measurements is just a tiny blip in Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history. Oster and her colleagues are particularly interested in the Last Interglacial Period, about 129,000 to 116,000 years ago. Back then, the planet may have been slightly warmer than it is today, similar to the low end of the temperature range predicted for the end of this century."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "The Last Interglacial Period could make it a good analogue for the coming decades. It also highlights what Cobb called the most important reason to study paleoclimate records: They can reveal the extraordinary nature of human-caused changes to Earth’s climate. The knowledge that global temperatures have not been this high in at least 125,000 years is powerful. “Being able to deliver numbers like that . . . put into full, unfortunately jaw-dropping, context exactly what we’re doing right now,” Cobb told me."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "To understand that context, or as much of it as possible, scientists must employ proxy measurements, like those made from tree rings. But wood rots; even the oldest tree ring data in the Northern Hemisphere goes back only about fourteen thousand years, and it’s more commonly used to understand just the last thousand or so years. But other archives last longer: ocean and lake sediments, for example, and cave formations."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "For paleoclimate records to be useful, scientists need to know the age of whatever they’re analyzing. And speleothems can be precisely dated, said Kathleen Johnson, a geochemist and paleoclimatologist at the University of California, Irvine, and a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The dating method most scientists use, called uranium-thorium dating, is accurate for about the last half a million years, so that’s how far back speleothem records typically go—if researchers can find the right ones."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "The trouble is that it’s impossible to distinguish, from the outside, a 3,000-year-old speleothem from a 300,000-year-old speleothem. Researchers have to crack them open and analyze them to find out. Still, there are some helpful signs: Stalagmites tend to generate a more useful record than stalactites, for example, because they grow in a more straightforward pattern. And a candlestick shape is a good indication of a slow and steady drip rate over time, which makes for a better analysis."
