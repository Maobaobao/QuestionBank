        "text": "Those words would surely resonate with McGowan. During an increase in COVID cases, as we approach a hospital where she works regular shifts, an ambulance pulls out of the parking lot, lights flashing, underneath looming clouds. “That’s probably another transfer,” McGowan says. Someone, in other words, has claimed one of the few available COVID beds in the region, meaning someone else—someone just as sick—may have to do without. Inside the ER, a bare-bones suite of rooms and hallways, glove boxes and black cords dangle from the walls. As we walk around, we spot warning signs of other moral compromises ahead. A scrawled note on a hallway whiteboard reads, “Critical shortage of green top tubes, 0-day supply of blue tops.” When these tubes run out, McGowan explains, she may not be able to order blood tests patients need—and, as a result, may have a hard time figuring out what’s wrong with them."

        "text": "On many days during the pandemic, McGowan has struggled with the dislocation of shuttling between the ER—a personal hell of COVID deniers, irate family members and dying patients and the outside world, which feels disturbingly normal. How, she wonders, can people nonchalantly chat and sip coffee when, minutes before, she sent someone home who could barely breathe? How can her own moral world be knocked so profoundly off-axis while the larger world continues to spin with scarcely a wobble?"

        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "McGowan sees a therapist to help her process the situations she’s faced, which she says has been helpful. Yet she continues to grapple with the fallout of moral dilemmas, reflecting a growing consensus that traditional therapy may not always be enough to help morally injured people get past lingering demons. Those who seek help sometimes make headway with basic cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the current gold standard among insurers. Some researchers think CBT approaches are sufficient to treat moral injury."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "But one sticking point with CBT is that it focuses on correcting clients’ distorted thought patterns. For people with moral injury who’ve experienced wrenching events that upend their entire value system, ethical distress is genuine, not the product of distorted thinking, Harwood-Gross says. If people with moral injury simply try to retrain their thoughts, they may be left unsatisfied and unhealed."

      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "Therapies for PTSD can likewise fall short for morally injured patients, in Harwood-Gross’s experience. PTSD-focused approaches teach clients to adapt to traumatic triggers, such as fireworks that sound like gunshots, but this exposure approach doesn’t really help them resolve deep ethical conflicts. Effective moral injury counseling is “more about the processing,” Harwood-Gross says. “There has to be that movement: ‘How do I see it for what it is and, from there, develop something more meaningful?’ It’s a more spiritual approach.”"

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Recognizing moral injury’s unique challenges, psychologists such as Litz have been creating therapies that more directly address clients’ needs. Litz and other providers have pioneered a moral injury treatment called adaptive disclosure. Researchers at Australia’s La Trobe University and University of Queensland have developed a similar approach called pastoral narrative disclosure. The latter involves discussing moral issues with a chaplain or other spiritual adviser rather than a doctor."

      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "These therapies stress the importance of moral reckoning. They encourage clients to accept uncomfortable truths: “I led that attack on Iraqi civilians”; “I sent that suffering patient home without treatment.” Then, with clients’ input, counselors can help them develop strategies for making amends or pursuing closure say, apologizing to a family whose child they injured."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Early evidence suggests these approaches make headway where others can’t. In Litz’s initial trial of adaptive disclosure on forty-four marines, participants’ negative beliefs about both themselves and the world diminished. Most also said the therapy helped to resolve their moral dilemmas."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "Earlier this year Litz wrapped up a 173-person clinical trial of adaptive disclosure at VA sites in Boston, Minneapolis, San Diego, San Francisco, and central Texas. The trial’s results have not yet been published, but Litz found that, in general, adaptive disclosure boosted participants’ level of functioning over time. Litz says his goal is not to wipe people’s moral slates clean but to restore their ability to thrive. “You’ll never not feel awful when you think about what happened,” Litz adds. “That’s going to be the new normal. The question is ‘How do you rehabilitate and live a good-enough life?’”"

        "text": "For Brock’s VOA team, moral injury rehabilitation also involves a suite of peer-support programs. The Shay Moral Injury Center’s core group offering, Resilience Strength Training (RST), is a sixty-hour, in-person program where people with moral injury share stories about events that caused it, engage in talks about forgiveness (for themselves or others), and do exercises to help them define their value system and purpose going forward In a survey study at two VOA program sites, participants scored an average of 46 percent higher on a scale of post-traumatic growth and 19 percent higher on a scale of perceived meaning in life than they had before starting the program. Although the in-person program paused during the pandemic, plans to restart it are currently underway."
