Some nights from his hole at BARRACKS LANE<br>As the sugar factory purred to sleep and the canes curled their tails like fields of kittens<br>Godspeed polished the moon to see better Rosalie’s face and proceeded to ROMANI<br>In the morning. Moved to MAGDHABA by rail. And 2 platoons formed escort<br>To prisoners of war passing through the immemorial shade of the staffroom after<br>the successful action at RAFA."

J. Floras<br>“A” boy died from dysentery. In the Quaker chapel alone Godspeed looked at<br>the white angels and the luxe hair Christ painted above the baptismal pool. He thought<br>Of the nub of magnet like a single black eye still whirling on the stalled fan."
