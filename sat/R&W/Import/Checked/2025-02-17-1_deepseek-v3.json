      "text": "Occasionally, the dancing itself was fatal—there were those who dropped dead from exhaustion, and in Utrecht, 200 people danced on a Mosel bridge until the structure collapsed and many drowned. Folklore with roots in this period, like 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin,' warns of rhythm’s seductive power. So do later tales like 'The Red Shoes,' in which the young girl who wears them must have her feet cut off to halt her cursed dancing. That story frightened me as a child, but it also shaped a lasting preference. When I go out, I find myself reaching for wine-colored suede ankle boots with a Cuban heel, as if to court the ecstasies of enchantment."

      "text": "I thought of those shoes when New York City’s second pandemic spring began to buzz with fantasies of freedom. Slowly, then quickly, people I knew lined up for the vaccines. By Memorial Day, the subways were crowded and the bars noisy again. We stumbled into the season’s audacious promise exhausted, delirious and seething with desire. I listened to Stevie Wonder’s 'Love Light in Flight' on loop, as if the song—we will fly forever and one hour—could restore the time we’d lost together. I followed a dozen DJs on Instagram. I texted my most festive friends. I mapped out New York City—birthplace of bugalú, salsa, hustle, vogue, breaking, flexing—and traced possible paths through a series of summer parties. When I opened Uber on my phone, the corporation’s new tagline amplified the siren song: 'The world’s opening up again. Where to first?'"

      "text": "Back then, the summer seemed luxuriously long. But our reckless rush to make the most of it told another story. Even before the sudden surge of the Delta variant, we knew whatever freedom we’d chosen to feel would be hyperlocal, most likely temporary, and possibly destructive. We were right to think it might be our only chance. At Papi Juice’s Pride party, when Destiny’s Child came on, the incandescent anxiety of our wish to be well made the bridge sound like a spell: I’m doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so good / Good, good, good, good, goooood. That very day at the Gotham Jazz Picnic in Central Park, where our feet disappeared in the dust kicked up by our Lindy-hopping, I danced with a widower in white linen who called me by his dead wife’s name. At Coney Island in late July, the celebrated B-boy turned DJ Tony Touch overstayed his boardwalk set and called out to his remaining audience: 'If you’re still here, I want you to act like it. I want to see that.'"

      "text": "We are still here. We are trying to find out what it means to act like it. Bourgeois propriety often seems to prefer a clear distinction between grief and jubilation. In Puerto Rico, nineteenth-century white criollos condemned the Afro-Indigenous practice of the baquiné, in which children who died very young were dressed in flowers, sometimes lace, and mourned with all-night vigils of drinking, drums, and dancing. But what always struck me as most mortifying was not the intensity of that display but the possibility that those of us left living do not love life enough to deserve our survival. I don’t believe in deserving, but I do believe we owe the dead a little dancing."

      "text": "The first night I went out for real was the Friday before the Puerto Rican Day Parade. My friends and I rode up from Brooklyn to the Bronx Brewery for A Party Called Rosie Perez, to hear DJ Laylo, Sucio Smash, and Christian Mártir play together live for the first time since 2019. I don’t like the parade—the corporate sponsorships, the political ring kissing—but I like how all the city’s Puerto Ricans seem to turn up at once, rowdy and rebellious, for the annual roll call. And I’d been to A Party Called Rosie Perez twice before, so I played along when a woman I didn’t quite recognize—long blond braids, little crystals at her tear ducts—threw her arms around my neck as soon I stepped inside the door. Later, when I passed her on the way to the bathroom, we locked eyes and both laughed: 'I’m not your girl, right?' 'No—I liked that you faked it though!'"

      "text": "None of us seemed to remember how long to look an unmasked stranger in the face, whether to speak up or simply drift into the orbit of someone else’s rhythm until touch could take over. For me, the tension broke when DJ Laylo dropped the early crossover house hit 'Show Me Love' and the off-key strain in the voice of Robin Stone—she had the flu at the studio session—cut through our second-guessing with the desperate power possessed by the sick. Words are so easy to say.… / You’ve got to show me love. It felt good to make our human needs known against the electronic grind, to remember machines could be our creative allies rather than our overseers. It’s been so long since / I touched a wanting hand. The government had failed to protect us and lied about the gravity of our collective condition. Don’t you promise me the world / All that I’ve already heard / This time around for me, baby / Actions speak louder than words. The only language that could reach us now would be the language of bodies assembling in tight quarters to show love, even if we fumbled when we reached for one another."

      "text": "The really skilled salseros had gathered on one side of the stage, and some of us wandered over to watch, caught between envy and admiration. I could see one woman’s training in her perfect spotting. A lanky dancer in a red bucket hat had incredible improvisational range, looked absolutely natural, even with the hint of show business I could see in the clean angle of his elbows. Andrew Avilá turned out to be a dancer for Lin-Manuel Miranda’s movie In the Heights, which premiered the night before—a South Bronx Puerto Rican Colombian who grew up dancing salsa at home with his mother before he turned professional. In previous generations, his great-grandfather crafted and played the folk guitar called the cuatro; his uncles played congas; and almost everybody danced at the Palladium Ballroom during the midcentury mambo craze. Whatever genius he possessed did not begin and would not end with him."

      "text": "I liked him best dancing with a radiant woman in a red crop top, loose black pants, and waist beads—she could have followed the turns I saw him spin other partners through, but instead she was eliciting his rhythmic playfulness, tremors traveling between their torsos. At one point—it wasn’t salsa anymore, but merengue—he tapped out the beat on the small of her back, and I saw her toss her head back and laugh with delight. I laughed, too, when I asked her name and it turned out to be just two letters off from my own, as if I’d dreamed myself into her dancing. Later, I asked Corinna Vega to remember that merengue moment. She couldn’t locate it precisely—of course not—but she remembered the feeling: 'The beauty of not knowing what happens next, the beauty of messing up and just like, you’re still going.'"

      "text": "Especially now, we’re tormented by the volatile future, the anxiety of adaptation. The uncertainty of the pandemic seems merciless. But dancing activates the pleasure in this roiling field of possibilities, makes it feel as if there will always be another chance to choose. To reset the connection. To find opportunity in error. Getting ready for her first night out in over a year, Corinna had wavered—'Like, do I still got it?' Once she was back in the moment, she remembered that dancing is not something you’ve got. It’s something you have to let get you."

      "text": "Christian Mártir took over the turntables for the last set. Palo crashed in, a ceremonial music, Congolese originally, developed in new directions in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. The drums in palo are made from hollowed-out logs. I’d seen—even learned a little—the corresponding dance, which is low to the ground, athletic, forceful, exhausting. Palo summons the dead, pounding the earth until they wake up and enter the living through the feet. At the party, it didn’t seem strictly necessary to know the details of this tradition or its historical trajectory in order to appreciate the primordial power of percussion and the human voice, our original instruments. To hear the persistence of Africa in the Americas.<br><br>'When you play that, you have a spiritual intention,' Mártir explained. 'It’s almost like people would say it’s disrespectful to play at the club.…' He trailed off, shook his head, began again. 'I can get the crowd hyped on whatever record’s on the radio,' he said. But to play something our grandmothers, great-grandmothers might recognize, 'that, to me, is beautiful, because you’re connecting all those generations, bringing them into the same space.' He paused. 'Nothing’s guaranteed, right?' And I think he meant to say that the music might not have survived but did. We can’t always afford to be precious about preserving the original context—better to get in where we fit in."
