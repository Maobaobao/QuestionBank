        "text": "Predictions of the kinds and numbers of jobs that will be replaced by generative AI abound. But it’s actually more helpful to think about the cognitive tasks that the technology could perform or help perform.<br><br>Research conducted by one of us (Daniel), OpenResearch’s Sam Manning, and OpenAI’s Tyna Eloundou and Pamela Mishkin took that approach. Their starting point was the ONET database, which has been maintained and updated by the U.S. government since 1998. ONET includes nearly 1,000 occupations and breaks each one down into its constituent tasks—typically 20 to 30 of them. For instance, according to ONET, radiologists have 30 distinct tasks, including \u201cperform or interpret the outcomes of diagnostic imaging procedures\u201d and \u201cdevelop treatment plans for radiology patients.\u201d"

        "text": "The researchers, with the assistance of people chosen by OpenAI, addressed two questions: Which tasks of each ONET job could be done at least twice as fast with the help of generative AI with no significant drop in quality? And of those \u201cexposed\u201d tasks, which needed at least one system in addition to generative AI to reap the productivity gains? The research team also asked OpenAI’s GPT-4 LLM the same two questions and compared its answers with those of the people. The answers were similar.<br><br>This effort revealed that 80% of U.S. workers have at least 10% of their tasks exposed to generative AI, and 19% of workers have more than half of their tasks exposed. But \u201cexposed\u201d doesn’t mean that those tasks will or should be automated. In many cases the best use of generative AI will be to make human workers more productive or creative, not to replace them."

        "text": "Leaders can undertake a version of this research approach to get a sense of where generative AI might be most productively applied in their organizations. Every board should expect its CEO to develop an actionable game plan. Doing so is a three-part process.<br><br>First, do a rough inventory of knowledge-work jobs: How many of your people primarily write for a living? How many data analysts, managers, programmers, customer service agents, and so on do you have?<br><br>Next, ask two questions about each role. The first is, \u201cHow much would an employee in this role benefit from having a competent but naive assistant—someone who excels at programming, writing, preparing data, or summarizing information but knows nothing about our company?\u201d Today’s publicly available LLMs are like such an assistant. The second question is, \u201cHow much would an employee in this role benefit from having an experienced assistant—someone who’s been at the company long enough to absorb its specialized knowledge?\u201d"

        "text": "Finally, once your company’s knowledge-work roles have been inventoried and those two questions have been answered, prioritize the most-promising generative-AI efforts. This task is straightforward: Choose the ones with the largest benefit-to-cost ratio. To estimate benefits, look at the total amount the company is spending on compensation for each role. The purpose is not to identify positions for elimination; rather, it’s to identify opportunities for big productivity improvements—where new digital assistants will be most valuable.<br><br>At present most generative AI projects are focused on improving specific tasks. That’s appropriate, because so many opportunities exist to use the technology that way. But as it matures and companies gain experience with it, generative AI efforts will encompass entire business processes instead of individual tasks. For example, they’ll be used to transform every aspect of a company’s interaction with customers, not just to improve online troubleshooting chats. Generative AI is still a nascent technology, and we can’t predict exactly how it will be put to work in the years ahead. But we can confidently predict that it will have a large role in the digital strategies of successful companies."
