        "text": "When I was young, sports seemed like a welcome oasis from the open racism around me. I had been shaken by reading about the brutal slaying years earlier of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till, whose murderers were acquitted by an all-white jury and who, once released, bragged to Look magazine that they’d killed him. Then, when I was seventeen, I accidentally got caught up in the Harlem riot of 1964, which broke out after a white cop killed a fifteen-year-old Black kid, James Powell. How was I to feel safe in a country where that could happen to me, simply because of the color of my skin?"

        "text": "But with basketball, the ball didn’t care who put it through the hoop. The game was based only on ability. If you had better skills, people wanted you on their team. No one cared who your parents were or how many friends you had. It was a pure, sweaty meritocracy. For me, it was a glimpse, however temporary, of the way the world should be. When I played, the world outside the gym doors, with all its irrational prejudices and enraged injustices, was silenced. There was the sound of the ball being dribbled, the squeal of sneakers on wood, and the cheers of the crowd when the ball slapped through the net."

        "text": "Of course, all paradises eventually fall. The more successful my high school team became, the bigger the crowds and the more I would hear the racial slurs and taunts. Even my beloved coach used the n-word, in a misguided attempt to fire me up. It did, but not in the way he’d anticipated. I began to realize that there really was no safe haven from racism. This inspired me to learn more about American history, and especially African American history, to understand why things were still this way a hundred years after the Civil War. I met Martin Luther King Jr. I read the words of Malcolm X. I stopped hiding in the gym."

        "text": "Even while playing at UCLA, I heard the same slurs and even threats. But it wasn’t just the overt racism that polluted the purity of the sport. I started playing for UCLA in 1966, and a year later, the NCAA banned the slam dunk. The ban, which lasted until 1976, was popularly known as the Lew Alcindor rule, because I had made liberal use of the slam dunk. In fact, many of the frequent slam dunkers were Black, and there was a definite feeling that the rule had been invoked to keep Black players from dominating."

        "text": "We all knew it was no coincidence that the rule was laid down less than a year after the all-Black players from Texas Western College defeated an all-white team from the University of Kentucky and won the national championship. Even that historic victory was tainted with racism: The custom was to bring out a ladder and ceremonially cut down the net. No ladder was brought out. Traditionally, the winners appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show to celebrate their victory. Not this time."

        "text": "As I graduated from college to the NBA and as more Black players were slowly integrating professional sports, a popular theory being tossed around was called Black athletic superiority, which credited the rise of the Black athlete to genetics. The gist was that white athletes earned their athletic success through hard work and grit while Black athletes were just born that way. In 2003, the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education addressed this claim: “If there is a ‘black gene’ that leads to athletic prowess, why then do African Americans, 90 percent of whom have at least one white ancestor, outperform blacks from African nations in every sport except long-distance running?”"

        "text": "Some would say, “Easy there, Kareem. That was all a long time ago. We’ve come a long way.” Yes, we have. But not as long a way as many white people think. There’s been plenty of publicity about how COVID-19 is having a much greater effect on the Black and Latino communities, both in the death rates and the economic devastation. Late last spring, an estimated 15 million to 26 million people marched to protest police brutality against Blacks, in the largest protest movement in U.S. history."

        "text": "The headlines are also filled with the current aggressive attempts of states across the country to pass 361 laws to restrict access to voting, which will mostly impact minority and poor voters. The definition of democracy is being rewritten to be exclusive rather than inclusive. And most of those being excluded have dark skin."

        "text": "How much have times changed? Amanda Gorman, the twenty-three-year-old Black poet who read at President Biden’s inauguration and then read again at the Super Bowl, is now one of the most recognizable Black people in the country. Yet, in March, she tweeted that she was followed home by a security guard who said she “looked suspicious” and demanded to know if she lived there. He did not leave until she showed him her keys and let herself in."

        "text": "Add that to the white woman, walking her dog in New York City’s Central Park, who called the police simply because a Black man reminded her that her dog needed to be on a leash. Or the Black graduate student at Yale, napping in her dorm’s common area, being questioned by police because another student thought she was not supposed to be there. And the two Black men, waiting for a friend at a Starbucks in Philadelphia, whom the manager called the police on because they were not paying customers."
