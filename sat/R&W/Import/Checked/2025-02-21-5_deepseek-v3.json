        "text": "Holihan and his partner reached their home in Washington, DC, and found some rapid tests tucked under their doormat—a gift from the friend who had texted his positive result. They both took them right away. Holihan’s test popped positive immediately. They masked up and maneuvered awkwardly around their apartment, trying to figure out where they could separately eat and sleep. The next morning, feverish and sweating, Holihan walked to a pop-up clinic for a PCR test, then went home to isolate."

        "text": "The next day, Monday, he emailed his office—he is the state legislative director for a gun-violence-prevention organization—to say he wouldn’t be in. He was already feeling better, but when his test result arrived, it was positive. Of course. “At that point I started texting everyone I’d come in contact with over the week,” he says. Realizing how many people visit Provincetown from across the country, he posted about being infected on Twitter and Instagram too. DMs flowed back, from people who thought they’d picked up some summer crud as they traveled. “They thought they were fine,” he says. “Then they tested themselves, and it turned out they also had COVID.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "One of the people Holihan texted was Donnelly. This might seem odd, because Donnelly isn’t an epidemiologist. He is a policy geek who has done macroeconomic forecasting at the Federal Reserve Board and data analysis at Spotify and Facebook. But since early 2020, Donnelly had also been applying his skills to forecasting what COVID might do in the US, a way of making sense for himself of the data flowing from other countries and explaining to others why they ought to be more worried than they were. “Essentially, I wanted to convince my friends it was bad,” he says."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "Donnelly’s analyses, which he initially published on Medium, had been solid. He had foreseen that federal action would be needed two days before President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. He had warned that New York City would have to shut down six days before Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the whole state would be put “on pause.” That prediction led to a consulting gig with New York state (forecasting possible case counts, bed needs, and ventilator orders) and then to founding a site called CovidOutlook.info, a home for reports and predictions that he spun up with Michael LeVasseur, an epidemiologist at Drexel University."

        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "So by the time the Delta variant began creeping through Provincetown, Donnelly was an informal but thoroughly informed expert in what COVID was doing in the US. “I had been tracking variants over the previous six months and, broadly, thought concerns about them were overblown,” he says. When his friends started testing positive, he was surprised and nettled. He didn’t like being wrong."

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Rumors about people testing positive were zipping through group chats: most of this house, everyone in that cottage; the Pennsylvania group, the California group, that couple from DC; ten people positive, or fifteen, or twenty-five. Text by text, Donnelly began verifying the stories, asking people about the symptoms they had and the tests they had taken, when they were vaccinated and which shot they got, and all the details of their visits to Provincetown—where they stayed, who they hung out with, which bars and restaurants and shows they went to. He started collecting information on Saturday afternoon, and by Monday he had more than fifty names in a spreadsheet."

        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "The list represented a shocking number of breakthrough infections for a young, healthy, affluent population, a group that should have been at the lowest risk. Donnelly felt an itch to do a study, but LeVasseur persuaded him to turn the project over to a bigger institution than their team of two. Donnelly got in touch with Demetre Daskalakis, the former head of the infectious disease programs in New York City’s health department, who was now at the CDC. On Monday night, Donnelly texted, offering the spreadsheet. Daskalakis asked for it immediately."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Within twenty-four hours, Daskalakis set up calls between Donnelly, the CDC, and the Massachusetts health department. By the end of the week, the agencies had created a task force, set up a phone number and an email for people to self-report, reached out to other states that visitors had gone home to, and gotten mobile testing units rolling toward Provincetown. “It’s the most accelerated response I’ve ever seen in public health,” Daskalakis says. “And Michael pretty much started that outbreak investigation himself.”"

        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "This ought to be obvious, but to make it clear: Everyone Donnelly interviewed, those who visited Provincetown and came away with a COVID infection, is gay. That was why they were in that place in one of its biggest tourist weeks of the year. But people don’t go to Provincetown just to party—they go for community. “Even if you live in LGBT-friendly neighborhoods, you’re still a minority,” says Rob Anderson, a former journalist who moved to the town a decade ago and owns a Commercial Street restaurant called The Canteen with his partner. “Even in New York, you can be walking down the street and get called a fag. When you come to Provincetown, you just get to be yourself. You feel normal, for the first time in your life.”"

      {
        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "The physical setting helps with that. Provincetown is remote—it lies at the dead end of miles of two-lane highway—and pretty in an unthreatening way, made up of low, shingled buildings surrounded by tidal marshes and soft ocean light. But its social norms help too. It is a place that takes openness to sex and gender expression as a basic social contract. That openness might show up as a guy wearing heels and fairy wings to the corner store, or a mom bringing her kids cross-country to the beach because every child there will have queer parents—or the town collectively accepting that tens of thousands of smooching, shouting people will flood the streets and clubs for the themed holidays that segment the summer: Memorial Day for young lesbians, July Fourth for gym guys, Bear Week right afterward for big, hairy men, special weeks for Black queer men and women, a raucous costumed Carnival to close out the summer."
