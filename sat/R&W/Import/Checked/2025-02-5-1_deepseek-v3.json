      "text": "The morning of Schaefer’s arrival on the ice sheet, three weeks earlier, was luminous and still. Barely a breeze jostled the helicopter that carried him to the field camp in northwest Greenland. Beneath him, the glittering expanse of the Prudhoe Dome ice cap resembled the ocean: Beautiful. Mysterious. Mind-bendingly huge.<br>Theoretically, Schaefer had already grasped this. The dome’s size was one reason it had been selected as a GreenDrill sampling site—the first of three strategic locations around Greenland where he and his colleagues planned to drill for bedrock samples over the next few years. Yet Schaefer was still stunned as the helicopter touched down on the dome’s summit. Despite a decades-long career in polar science, this was his first time on an ice sheet. 'It’s a monster,' he thought. Schaefer tried to imagine all that ice melting and flowing into the ocean. The catastrophic possibility made him shiver."

      "text": "He knew that such a disaster had happened before. In 2016, Schaefer and his close colleague Jason Briner, GreenDrill’s co-director and a geology professor at the University at Buffalo, were part of a team that analyzed the single bedrock sample that had been previously collected from beneath the thickest part of the ice sheet. The rock contained chemical signatures showing it had been exposed to the sky in the past 1.1 million years. In a paper they published in the journal Nature, the scientists concluded that almost all of Greenland—including regions now covered by ice more than a mile deep—must have melted at least once within that time frame.<br>'That was a game changer,' said Neil Glasser, a glaciologist at Aberystwyth University who has followed Schaefer’s research. 'It said that the Greenland Ice Sheet is far more dynamic than we had ever thought.'"

      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "The findings ran counter to many scientists’ belief that Greenland has been relatively stable throughout recent geologic history, as the Earth oscillated between ice ages and milder warm periods known as interglacials. If the ice sheet could melt at a time when global temperatures never got much higher than they are now, it was a worrying harbinger of what ongoing human-caused warming might bring.<br>For Schaefer and Briner, the discovery also underscored how bedrock could complement findings from ice cores—the long slices of frozen material that had traditionally been the focus of polar science. For decades, scientists had studied air bubbles trapped in ice to uncover crucial clues about the climate at the time the ice formed.<br>Yet ice cores, by their very nature, could only reveal what happened during the colder phases of Earth’s history. They couldn’t answer what Schaefer said is arguably the most important question facing humanity now: 'What happened when it got warm?'"

      "text": "With GreenDrill—which is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation—he and Briner aimed to open up a new kind of record, one that didn’t melt away. By collecting bedrock samples from around the island, they could gain a clearer picture of exactly when the ice sheet last vanished and what parts of Greenland melted first.<br>But to get those rocks, they would need to survive for more than a month in one of the most remote and hostile places on Earth.<br>The effort was shaping up to be harder than anyone had anticipated. It took seven plane trips for the team to haul GreenDrill’s equipment onto the ice sheet. Twice they were delayed by blizzards. Then a windstorm halted work on the drill for three full days.<br>The scientists who oversaw camp setup—Lamont Doherty geologist Nicolás Young and University at Buffalo Ph.D. student Caleb Walcott—already looked exhausted as they welcomed Schaefer to the ice."
