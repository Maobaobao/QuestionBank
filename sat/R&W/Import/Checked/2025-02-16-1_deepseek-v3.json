        "text": "The next day, I drive to meet Jamie Maclean at one of the pastures where he keeps his sheep. Mull is a strange landscape, both rugged and manicured. On the one hand, it feels quite wild and remote. Sheer cliffs plunge into the sea; oystercatchers and lapwings strut around the empty beaches, and in the steepest ravines, where sheep fear to tread, there are fairy-tale woodlands, with mossy oaks, dripping ferns, and carpets of bluebells and celandine in the spring. But much of Mull is used as grazing land for sheep and cattle, and they do a thorough job, keeping the hills nibbled short. It looks a little bit like the perfectly round grass hills on the set of the iconic children’s show Teletubbies, except inhabited by sheep instead of slightly eerie anthropomorphic puppet people."

        "text": "Maclean hops out of a Toyota Hilux. He is thirty-two and fresh faced, and we go for a stroll through one of these lawn-like landscapes. As we move slowly through his sheep, they gently adjust their position, keeping calm but also keeping a healthy distance from us. Maclean tells me that there are ten breeding pairs of eagles on the ground he and his uncle pasture their sheep on. At this site, where the flock comprises four hundred breeding ewes, he figures they lose maybe thirty lambs a year to the eagles. “It is so hard to tell,” he says. In the style of farming employed on Mull, known as hill farming, ewes are often scanned by ultrasound in the winter to see if they are carrying one or two lambs. They typically give birth on their own, in the hills. Later, the farmers count all the singles and twins and compare the count with the predicted number based on the scans. But some lambs are born dead or die of disease or cold. Crows and jackdaws and gulls peck at sickly lambs. Some fall off cliffs. Determining which ones disappear due to eagle predation is difficult. The proportion of lambs that simply disappear is known as black loss and the fraction of that that is due to eagles remains a source of endless debate."

        "text": "Since 2016, Maclean has put out fish for some of the eagles and watched them swoop in to dine when he was just 15 or 20 meters away. “They aren’t really scared,” he says. But he reckons the feeding did reduce his lamb losses. I ask him how he felt about the pair I’d seen when this year’s chick died. Did he feel sad for them? He smiles at the thought. He says he is “not too fussed really.” “Mull is at capacity for eagles,” he adds. It doesn’t need more. Sexton would quibble with him, arguing that a few more pairs could probably fit on the island. But there are indubitably a lot of eagles on Mull. I ask Maclean, If you were presented with a magic button that would get rid of all Mull’s eagles instantly, would you press it? He thinks about it for some time, then answers that he would not. Some of his friends benefit from birding tourism. “I wouldn’t do anything to get rid of them. They are pretty incredible birds.” But he wouldn’t mind having the right to get rid of individual eagles that are particularly troublesome. “Some birds are a lot worse than others.”"

        "text": "I hear very similar sentiments from all the sheep farmers I speak to on my visit. Eagles are here to stay on Mull and provide economic benefits in the form of tourism revenue—often to the sheep farmers themselves, most of whom are also renting out vacation cottages. But the farmers still don’t really like them. And how could they? The central purpose of a shepherd’s life is to raise sheep. Yes, the sheep are destined to be killed and eaten, but until they are slaughtered, they are in the care of the farmer, who must keep them alive and healthy at all costs, around the clock, in the wet and cold. Seeing a massive raptor flying over the field with the bloody carcass of one of the tiny fluffy lambs you just spent a year trying to nurture and protect feels like a punch in the gut. Proposed fixes are, generally speaking, dismissed by the farmers I speak to. Bringing the entire flock in to lamb indoors is impractical for many operations and spreads disease. Additional shepherds are hard to find and too expensive. And so on."

        "text": "Farmers are particularly annoyed that conservationists long denied that eagles ever preyed on live lambs. Sexton and other bird experts acknowledge that this may occasionally happen, but they still maintain that the eagles are much more likely to scavenge a lamb that has died of something else or steal a lamb from another predator than to attack a perfectly healthy lamb. Sexton’s line is that they are seldom the ultimate cause of death. “Whilst they might have been seen carrying the lamb off, or indeed feeding on it, and it might even still be warm, they didn’t start the process, right? They are taking advantage of something that other predators have started,” Sexton says, pointing out that gulls, ravens, and crows are well-known lamb killers. Farmers tend to disagree. Many of my interviews quickly devolve into discussions of exactly how many lambs eagles kill, and I can hear people—farmers and eagle advocates alike—slip into bitter grooves, reciting arguments to me that they have made many, many times before. The eagles, it appeared, had not become an unremarkable part of the flora and fauna over time. They are still making everyone mad."

        "text": "I sit on a bench overlooking the harbor in the almost comically picturesque town of Tobermory and watch Italians and Londoners with binoculars slung around their necks eat fish and chips and snap selfies. As an environmental journalist who has written frequently about wolf reintroduction in North America, I am a bit depressed. I had been so hopeful that after all these years the eagle would have been thoroughly reintegrated into both the ecosystem and the human-nonhuman community of Mull. In my naive optimism, I assumed that as soon as a generation of farmers grew up in a world with eagles, they would take them for granted as a rightful part of the island’s life. But instead, they nurse a grudge, against the birds and the birds’ advocates. Because every time a glimpse of a magnificently soaring eagle makes them decide that maybe the birds aren’t so bad, they come around a corner on their quad bikes and find a pile of guts and wool and wonder if an eagle has just blithely killed yet another of their lambs."

        "text": "I think back to a conversation I had had on the train toward Mull. A young woman told me that the first time she had taken the journey through the Highlands, she had become overcome by the beauty of the landscape and had felt an almost out-of-body sensation, as if she were “flying alongside the train.” I was happy for her, but when I looked out of the window, I saw a landscape that looked a lot like my home in Oregon—except denuded. The basics looked right: the steep mountains, the little rocky coastal islands, the moist air. But instead of being clothed up to their summits by a tangle of temperate rainforest, the mountains were covered with sheep lawn. There are extensive timber plantations in the Highlands and on the Hebrides as well, including on Mull, but the endless rows of same-aged Sitka spruce don’t host much biodiversity and don’t look quite right to my eye either."

        "text": "On my journey to Mull, I picked up a copy of The Lost Rainforests of Britain by Guy Shrubsole. He argues that some 20 percent of Britain—much of the western coast, including especially the Scottish Highlands and Hebrides—was once temperate rainforest, similar to the old-growth forests in Washington and British Columbia. According to the map in the book, thousands of years ago, Mull could have been nearly all forest, a woodland of pine, oak, hazel, and elm. And presumably any white-tailed eagles living there at that time would have lived a life similar to forest-dwelling bald eagles in the Pacific Northwest: nesting on tall snags above the canopy, working the forest-beach edge, fishing for salmon and mackerel, hunting ducks and seabirds, stealing prey from other predatory species, maybe nabbing the odd otter pup. Today, while fish and birds are available to white-tailed eagles, they are also confronted with a vast swath of open land, populated, each spring, with newborn lambs taking their first wobbly steps, exposed and knock-kneed, weighing just 2.5 kilograms. It would be kind of bizarre if they didn’t eat some lambs."

        "text": "Returning to a world before sheep is not the goal of most British conservationists—nor should it be. Nature is dynamic, not static, and it is neither possible nor desirable to simply roll back all human changes on the land. But taking a deeper time perspective helps me see that there have been many Mulls over the millennia, and it enlarges my sense of what might be possible in the future. I realize I had been expecting some kind of frictionless coexistence to develop on Mull purely based on goodwill. Maybe hill farming was simply not fully compatible with dense eagle populations. But then which use of the land should have priority? Sheep or eagles? White-tailed eagles are not globally endangered. They are so common in Russia, Norway, and China that the species is ranked as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. So the argument for their presence isn’t that the white-tailed eagle needs to be saved. The argument is these sea eagles belong on Mull. But many would also say that sheep belong on Mull."
