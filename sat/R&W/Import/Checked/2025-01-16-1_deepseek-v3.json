      "text": "Air France, first-class cabin, the boredom ameliorated by champagne and Cognac and the in-flight cuisine, which only the French, Germans, and Dutch still seemed to care about, though he wasn’t particularly hungry, not after three glasses of Taittinger, so he sat back and engaged with a new novel by one of his rivals, which so maddened him with its grace and fluidity that he finally had to put it aside and just stare out the window until the clouds below crept inside his skull and everything went pleasantly fuzzy, though he didn’t sleep. He never slept on airplanes, no matter that he had his own gleaming little pod and the seat reclined into a simulacrum of a bed. He just couldn’t get past the idea of his own fragility, suspended in the ether at thirty-five thousand feet like an unscrambled egg in a hurtling aluminum shell."

      "text": "Across the aisle from him, in her own pod, was a woman of thirty or so with a honed physique and a face that wasn’t conventionally pretty but was darkly erotic like that of a French actress from the sixties whose name he could never remember. Before takeoff, she’d talked on her phone in very bad Spanish to her maid or housekeeper or au pair about her daughter’s needs and expectations, then washed down two tiny white pills with her champagne and fallen unconscious. She didn’t move at all, not even to change position, until they were descending into Orly and the flight attendant was obliged to bend down and rouse her, at which point she hustled to the lavatory with her makeup bag. When they landed, she swept off the plane like a diva emerging from the wings to a roar of applause. As for Riley, he felt as if he’d been shot through the breastbone with a very short, very thick arrow—from a crossbow, wasn’t that what they were called? He shuffled down the aisle like one of the walking dead, his roller bag clipping his heels all the way."

      "text": "The good news was that Mireille was waiting for him in the arrivals hall. She was his editor, the granddaughter of the man who had founded the publishing house, and since all editorial decisions were made in New York long before the manuscript reached her desk their relationship was relatively uncomplicated. She vetted the translation, and if it passed muster with her he was fine with that, because he wasn’t about to blunder through it himself, even with Google to fluently obfuscate things for him. There was the embrace, the three obligatory air kisses, and never mind the virus that was just beginning to infest the news reports (a virus that no one really knew anything about, so why worry?). And then she was asking him if he’d slept on the plane and, lying because it seemed appropriate, essential, even, he told her that he had."
