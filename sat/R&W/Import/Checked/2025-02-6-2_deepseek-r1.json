      "text": "Inside the small Los Alamos History Museum, there is a wedding dress. It is made from parachute nylon. The Manhattan Project physicist Albert Bartlett got the material from an explosives testing site and had the dress made for his wife, Eleanor. There is a penlight, worn in the pocket of one of the bomber pilots on the Nagasaki mission. There is a skin drum that belonged to Richard Feynman. (Back in the day, the scientists would gather after work and play music together.) There are gold teeth caps to protect the physicist Al Graves from his own fillings, which had become radioactive after he was exposed to radiation during an accident that killed the scientist Louis Slotin. There is a photograph of one of the three known spies to have infiltrated the Manhattan Project. They passed the secrets on to the Soviets, which is how they created their own nuclear weapons. The spies were not discovered until after the war."

      "text": "Looking at these things I feel both curious and uneasy. Looking at the penlight worn by the Nagasaki bomber nauseates me. He lived a long and healthy life after dropping that bomb. My friend who works at the Lab assures me that Fat Man and Little Boy saved far more lives in the long run than they killed. But they killed more than 200,000 people. Those exact lives were not saved; I don’t believe in necessary evils. But I also don’t know that I am completely against nuclear weapons, as I was when I was a teenager in Santa Fe, protesting the Lab, protesting the Gulf War, seeing things in black and white.<br><br>Right outside the Fuller Lodge, there is a twelfth-century Indian pueblo site. There are grids of pale brown volcanic rocks in the grass—the floor plans for the pueblo. The rooms are so small, I don’t know how people could really use them. It’s amazing to stand inside the ruins of the abandoned city from a thousand years ago, right where Oppenheimer and the other scientists lived and ate and drank and bathed while they built the bombs."

      "text": "Los Alamos is on a plateau, and there are incredible views of mountains and cliffs in all directions. The air is fresh, the sky bright blue. There are tall pine trees, singing birds.<br><br>Not far from the Fuller Lodge is Ashley Pond, full of ducks, geese, carp, and koi. My son and I walk to the nearby Starbucks and get salami, cheese, and hot chocolates, and sit under a huge ponderosa pine tree and look at the pond while we eat. Then we walk around the pond, and my navy-blue sun hat blows off my head and into the water. A man on the other side takes off his shoes and goes into the pond and retrieves my hat for me. Los Alamos is a friendly city. There is very little crime."

      "text": "Los Alamos feels electric. It’s exciting, haunted and ominous. For many years, I never wanted to go anywhere near the place. It feels strange to be here now because it feels good, it feels safe, it’s beautiful. It’s also fascinating to be in the history and near the secrecy. There’s a volcano nearby that erupted one million years ago, spewing debris thousands of miles, all the way to Kansas. There were dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex. Various tribes of Indigenous Americans lived here for thousands of years before the Europeans came. Then it was a deserted mountain with a prestigious boys’ school on it and nothing else. Then the site for one of the most significant scientific achievements of all time. Everyone knows about it—everyone knows about the making of the atomic bomb. But that’s old history. What are they doing there now? What secrets are they keeping that we will one day learn about, or that perhaps will never be openly revealed? I know there’s a lot of space research there. Life on other planets, UFOs.<br><br>There have been mysterious sightings of green fireballs over Los Alamos since the 1940s. Scientists and skeptics have verified these sightings, and the fact is that they don’t know what they are. The fireballs have been recorded hundreds of times over Los Alamos and also over the Sandia National Laboratories, in Albuquerque, another military lab. In 1951, Time magazine published an article called “Green Balls of Fire” about the phenomenon. Recently, there has been more news about the green fireballs, and their unnerving concentration around sensitive military sites. The US government is worried, but not much more is publicly known about exactly how worried and what they’re doing about it. My friend just smiles when I ask her about it and doesn’t say a word."
