        "text": "The last day of winter, a Saturday, was the first day of the holidays. That evening Anny was minding a baby she’d minded before. He was a tremendous sleeper, but she left the door to his room open and didn’t watch TV in case he cried. The lounge was snug from the kerosene heater, there were snacks on the coffee table, and she knew to help herself to hot drinks. For a while she ate Cheezels and went on with The Mayor of Casterbridge, pausing now and then to blow cheesy orange dust off a page. She hadn’t had a class with Mr. Cullen in the two days of term left after The Crucible, but she’d observed him down corridors and across the yard. She saw a starman, fallen from the sky. It wasn’t only America he’d shed but every other country."

        "text": "The cabinet in the lounge had stained-glass lozenges in the doors and a delicate brass key in the lock. The baby’s parents kept the flat bottle there, hidden inside a china tureen. When they went out for an evening they always carried a bottle of wine; there was beer in their fridge and a cask of red on a kitchen shelf. It seemed obvious to Anny that the gin was an unwanted present. The bottle had been opened; she’d done that, risking a few swigs when she was last here. She had another gulp now, twisted on the cap, and tucked the bottle into her bag. The candle she’d used the previous time was still in its candlestick. She lifted it out, lay on the carpet, and wriggled her jeans and knickers below her knees."

        "text": "When the baby’s parents returned, the man offered to walk her home. She declined as usual, saying she lived only five minutes away. Fifteen minutes later she was across the street from Mr. Cullen’s place: a blond-brick block, two flats downstairs and two up, with an external stair. A light showed in one window, TV was leaking through the venetians in another, and the parking lot was lit up like a stage. The only empty car space had a big white number 4 painted on the concrete. It told Anny which flat belonged to Mr. Cullen, who didn’t drive. She loitered for a while, summoning authority from her coat, readying herself to knock on his door."

        "text": "A car arrived from nowhere and swung into the vacant parking spot. The street was dark, and in any case the people who got out of the Holden were involved only with each other. Crossing that concrete stage, Mr. Cullen delivered a lesson in what it meant to be a starman: someone with no memories and no past. He put his arm around Miss Kelso, and she leaned into him as her boots went tok-tok-tok up the stairs."

        "text": "Anny moved through the night, drinking gin. When she turned south, the wind was a wolf. There was something hard under her right foot, and she realized it was the pavement; her shoe had worn through."

        "text": "The lights along Broadway had been placed there solely to expose stupidity and shame. But she had to go that way, past the plane trees that would give her hay fever in November, to get to Lou’s. The first time she went to Lou’s house, they’d dabbed scotch behind their ears like perfume. Through the bare vaults of the trees a toothy fragment of moon could be seen. A solid, awkward shape like that started working its way up through Anny’s thoughts. Eventually it informed her that it was Joe’s father’s fiftieth and that Lou had gone to the party."

        "text": "She wavered for an instant. But there was still Maeve—Maeve, who’d looked at her in the pink coat and said, Your face should be on money. Maeve would be warm and uninquisitive, she’d offer Irish coffee in a tall white mug with a shamrock and invite her to curl up on the cushions on her floor—at the thought of those big, soft cushions, Anny couldn’t wait to lie down. A car slowed, its headlights assessing, before accelerating away. She saw the shortcut by the canal, its protective dark."

        "text": "Stones poked up through her shoe and hurt her foot as she made her way past backyards with overhanging trees. When the path finally opened out, she stepped gratefully onto the grass. She sat down, removed her shoes, and rubbed her sore foot. It was another starry, starry night. Learning of the American bombs that fell over Hanoi for twelve days and nights, she’d pictured death-dealing Christmas stars. Was poetry a kind of ideological work, or just an unhealthy tendency? She was mostly aware of a subdued, greeny-brown smell, not altogether unpleasant, rising from the water. When the gin was gone, she unbuttoned her coat and spread it beneath her legs. Before lying down, she hurled the empty bottle into the canal, following it with her shoes, one by one."

        "text": "Perhaps they heard the splashes and anticipated trouble, because they approached without a sound. She was still there, the cold just starting to enter her, when they arrived. They found her with her feet bare and her eyes closed, arranged on shining satin as if set out for their delight."

        "text": "Time passed. Anny was strolling beside the river in Shanghai. In 1949, as Mao’s army advanced, the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek made off with all the gold in China. Laborers transferred the bullion from a bank on the Bund to a freighter waiting to take it to Taiwan. There was also the end of Man’s Estate, when the revolutionary Katow sacrificed his cyanide to two young comrades in a Shanghai prison and went to his death by fire. These scenes flickered through her mind, illuminated fish, before sinking back into the weedy dark."
