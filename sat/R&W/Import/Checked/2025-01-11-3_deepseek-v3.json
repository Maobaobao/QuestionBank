        "text": "One language to rule them all, one language unites them. Chief among misguided policies is the mandate of a multilingual government, says a certain congressional representative in California. By discouraging immigrants and their children from using the English language, this policy has erected a linguistic barrier that keeps many immigrants from becoming full participants in the society they have chosen to join. Ten days from now the blastocyst inside you will affix to the uterine wall."

        "text": "Water mama papa brrr, says the baby in the bathtub, an impeccable host to the newly minted mother tongue of the world. Mama water papa brrr. Doggie donkey me. Me go. Me go bye-bye. Who needs a world without a word for indigo or plop, without vowels or numbers after five? What use are those thirty-seven tiny fish taxonomies or the compound words for castrated reindeer? Who needs words like abubu for mythical creatures that no longer exist? I had constructed with skillful craftsmanship two fierce deluge monsters to place at the royal door to the left and right of the locks, says one Assyrian to another. It probably took two weeks. Two weeks after the implantation of the blastocyst, the heart develops in the embryo. Why eat lilies? So bitter. Ortelius’s tomb in Antwerp reads that he “served quietly, without accusation” and now his bones are pressed against the water table, which rises as the glaciers melt, flowing beneath him mysteriously as though called by the time-telling tides of the moon."

Goodbye, ibex and tiny fish with the missing taxonomies, ten days from now, thanks to the ichthyologist from Brookhaven, your cells will replicate in a petri dish somewhere in a lab in Houston. This year his two-week vacation is mandatory. Hello, new tiny fish. Hello, pretend mammoth that will walk the earth someday soon with its partially manufactured old soul. Babel is also reputed to be the mother of singing. Goodbye, tiny black disappearing dots on the map where two very old people meet or do not meet to say tea, cake, your friendship is both storm and flood, your eyes are lanterns, I am about to speak and about not to speak, I have carried off to Assyria the rest of his children and his entire family and even the bones of your father, the city in which we live will not rise from ruin, then they are quiet, just saying the words ruin, ruins, hello, ruins, in the way only they will know, the way that, once buried, will never return to our ears."
