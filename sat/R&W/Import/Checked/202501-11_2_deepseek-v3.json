        "text": "Predictions of the kinds and numbers of jobs that will be replaced by generative AI abound. But it’s actually more helpful to think about the cognitive tasks that the technology could perform or help perform.<br><br>Research conducted by one of us (Daniel), OpenResearch’s Sam Manning, and OpenAI’s Tyna Eloundou and Pamela Mishkin took that approach. Their starting point was the ONET database, which has been maintained and updated by the U.S. government since 1998. ONET includes nearly 1,000 occupations and breaks each one down into its constituent tasks—typically 20 to 30 of them. For instance, according to O*NET, radiologists have 30 distinct tasks, including 'perform or interpret the outcomes of diagnostic imaging procedures' and 'develop treatment plans for radiology patients.'"

        "text": "The researchers, with the assistance of people chosen by OpenAI, addressed two questions: Which tasks of each O*NET job could be done at least twice as fast with the help of generative AI with no significant drop in quality? And of those 'exposed' tasks, which needed at least one system in addition to generative AI to reap the productivity gains? The research team also asked OpenAI’s GPT-4 LLM the same two questions and compared its answers with those of the people. The answers were similar.<br><br>This effort revealed that 80% of U.S. workers have at least 10% of their tasks exposed to generative AI, and 19% of workers have more than half of their tasks exposed. But 'exposed' doesn’t mean that those tasks will or should be automated. In many cases the best use of generative AI will be to make human workers more productive or creative, not to replace them."

        "text": "Programmers are a case in point. They already heavily use LLMs like GitHub Copilot to write the first draft of their code, but they still have to correct errors; consult with managerial, engineering, and technical personnel to clarify the program’s intent; train subordinates; and perform many other tasks that are unsuitable for generative AI. As LLMs get better at writing code, programmers will have more time and energy to devote to other tasks. (For more about how generative AI can help but not replace workers, see 'How Generative AI Can Augment Human Creativity,' HBR, July–August 2023.)<br><br>Leaders can undertake a version of this research approach to get a sense of where generative AI might be most productively applied in their organizations. Every board should expect its CEO to develop an actionable game plan. Doing so is a three-part process."

        "text": "First, do a rough inventory of knowledge-work jobs: How many of your people primarily write for a living? How many data analysts, managers, programmers, customer service agents, and so on do you have?<br><br>Next, ask two questions about each role. The first is, 'How much would an employee in this role benefit from having a competent but naive assistant—someone who excels at programming, writing, preparing data, or summarizing information but knows nothing about our company?' Today’s publicly available LLMs are like such an assistant. They can write code, for example, but they don’t know what your software development or systems integration needs are. They can create a project plan or critique an existing one, but they don’t know what projects you’re working on."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "The second question is, 'How much would an employee in this role benefit from having an experienced assistant—someone who’s been at the company long enough to absorb its specialized knowledge?' The software company described at the start of this article didn’t need naive customer-service agents; it needed agents who knew what kinds of problems occurred with its products and could work effectively with customers to solve them. That’s why it combined a customer-facing LLM with in-context learning. As this example indicates, when a company needs access to its specific internal knowledge, it must typically combine 'off the shelf' generative AI with another system.<br><br>Finally, once your company’s knowledge-work roles have been inventoried and those two questions have been answered, prioritize the most-promising generative-AI efforts. This task is straightforward: Choose the ones with the largest benefit-to-cost ratio."

        "text": "At present most generative AI projects are focused on improving specific tasks. That’s appropriate, because so many opportunities exist to use the technology that way. But as it matures and companies gain experience with it, generative AI efforts will encompass entire business processes instead of individual tasks. For example, they’ll be used to transform every aspect of a company’s interaction with customers, not just to improve online troubleshooting chats. Generative AI is still a nascent technology, and we can’t predict exactly how it will be put to work in the years ahead. But we can confidently predict that it will have a large role in the digital strategies of successful companies."
