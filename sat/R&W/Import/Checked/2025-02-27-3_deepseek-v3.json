        "text": "In one of our first conversations, Davis described the difference between method acting, which requires a performer to completely subsume herself into the life of her character, and a more technical approach that might, say, rely on breathing techniques to be able to readily cry. “I believe in the marriage of both, because I want to go home at the end of the day,” she said. She thinks that actors need to study life itself. Feelings are never simple; the mind wanders off track. “I always use this example of when my dad died, and we were devastated,” she told me. But at the wake, when people streamed through the doors to pay their respects, “it became this big reunion of laughing and remembering—real laughter to real joy, then tears. But I was observing my thoughts, and I went from being devastated one moment to thinking about what I was going to eat.” It’s like a Chekhov play: you can’t tell the story of the joy without telling the story of the pain alongside it."

        "text": "“Your thoughts go every which way,” she said. “They run the gamut. There’s a wide berth of life. It’s like, as soon as you think your life is falling apart, then you’re laughing hysterically. That’s how life works.”"

        "text": "Davis was born in 1965 on a plantation in South Carolina. Her grandparents were sharecroppers who raised eleven children in a single-room house. Mae Alice and Dan Davis, her parents, moved Viola and two of her older siblings to Rhode Island soon after Davis’s birth so that her father could find a better job. Dan was a well-regarded but underpaid horse groomer. He also regularly abused his wife after drinking binges, stabbing her in the neck with a pencil or thrashing her with a wood plank. Sometimes Davis would arrive home and see droplets of blood leading to the front door; at least once, Dan asked his daughters to help him look for their mother, who had run away in the middle of a beating, so he could kill her."

        "text": "The family rarely had heat, hot water, gas, soap, a working phone, or a toilet that flushed. Rats overtook their home, so ravenous that they ate the faces off Davis’s dolls. She and sisters would tie bedsheets around their necks before they went to sleep to stave off rat bites. Her father often beat her mother at night, and Davis started wetting the bed, a habit she didn’t break until she was a teenager. The conditions of her home meant that she often couldn’t wash up or change into another set of clean clothes. A teacher shamed her about her hygiene but never asked the root cause. Other teachers just ignored her: one day, Davis raised her hand to go to the bathroom, but the teacher never called on her, so she peed in the seat. The teacher sent her home, and the next day, when she arrived back at her desk, the urine was still pooled in her chair. Davis surmised that she was so disgusting that even the janitor didn’t want to clean her mess. She was six years old."

        "text": "Her sisters were her anchor. The eldest, Dianne, had recently reunited with her siblings, moving from their grandparents’ home in the South, and Viola was obsessed with her. She had a new coat and pocket change, and she smelled nice. It was the first time Dianne saw how the rest of her family lived, and she decided that her baby sister needed to get out. She whispered to Viola: “You need to have a really clear idea of how you’re going to make it out if you don’t want to be poor for the rest of your life. You have to decide what you want to be. Then you have to work really hard.”"

        "text": "One evening, Davis sat watching TV, the working set sitting atop a broken one, connected to an extension cord from one of the few functioning outlets in her home. The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman came on, and for the first time, Davis saw a dark-skinned woman, with full lips and a short Afro, on the screen. She thought the woman was beautiful; she thought the woman looked just like her mother. “My heart stopped beating,” she writes. “It was like a hand reached for mine, and I finally saw my way out.” Dianne had made clear that Viola could be somebody. Cicely Tyson was somebody Viola could be."

        "text": "When she was fourteen, Davis intervened in one of her parents’ fights for the first time. Her father stood opposite his wife, screaming and carrying on, a drinking glass in his hand like a dare. “ ‘Tell me I won’t bust yo’ head open, Mae Alice? Tell me I won’t?’ ” she writes. Davis tried to cut in, her eighteen-month-old sister in her arms, calmly pleading for him to stop.<br><br>Dan lifted his arm and smashed the glass onto Mae Alice’s face. A shard sliced her temple. As he moved to swing again, Davis yelled. Dan froze, still gripping the glass. “I screamed, ‘Give it to me!’ ” she writes. “Screaming as if the louder I became the more my fear would be released.” It worked. Her father handed Viola the glass, and she stashed it away."

        "text": "Davis grew up to be the sort of actor whose range feels best measured by her steady command of pressure: maintaining it, raising it, letting it go. She sets the tone of every scene, the eyes of her castmates flicking toward her as soon as she appears, as if reacting to her is a crucial part of the job. She often plays characters who cry only in the moments she’s inhabiting, weeping as if it were a rare, almost undignified departure from their norm. Her name has become internet shorthand for dramatic crying: after an episode of HBO’s Euphoria” this winter in which Zendaya sobbed and snotted her way through a scene, she drew enthusiastic comparisons to Davis. Davis doesn’t cry so much as she leaks, her eyes and nose like faucets. During her performance as Mrs. Miller in the 2008 movie Doubt, she cries one drop at a time. Her tears hang over the edges of her lashes; a single teardrop stays on its precipice for fifteen seconds. Mucus runs down her face undisturbed for two minutes, an eternity, its very presence signaling something terribly wrong. In the 2016 film adaptation of Fences, when her character unloads her stymied dreams onto her husband, her curled upper lip is no match for the snot dripping down her face."

        "text": "In real life, Davis doesn’t cry that much. “As a matter of fact, if someone confronted me with something, I would probably come at them with more unbridled anger than tears,” she said one March afternoon at her home in Los Angeles. When I arrived, her dog, Bailey, greeted me with an enthusiastic familiarity; Davis laughed and wondered aloud whether he thought I was her sister. Eventually, we made our way to the movie room, where she sat curled up under a plush blanket. She wore a dark head wrap knotted in the front and a key-lime linen jumpsuit. Davis is goofy and surprisingly coarse (her favorite swear words, she said, are basically unchanged from when she was eight), and looking at her, it was difficult to imagine that anyone had ever doubted her beauty."

        "text": "In order for Davis to descend into a new character, she told me, she first has to become a “human whisperer,” inviting the person into her life and making space for her revelations. She’s the vessel, not the creator. From a script, an actor may learn only the broad strokes of her character, and the rest is up to her to intuit. “You begin to ask your questions based on those facts,” Davis said. Say your character is 300 pounds. “ ‘Why are you so big?’ ‘Oh, I eat too much.’ ‘Well, why do you eat too much?’ ‘Because it comforts me.’ ‘Well, why does it comfort you?’ ‘Because I have a lot of anxiety.’ ‘Why do you have a lot of anxiety?’ ‘Because I was sexually abused when I was five. And every time I go to bed at night, I think about that sexual abuse, and I can’t go to sleep, so I eat.’ ” She punched the air. “Bam. You have a character. Keep asking why.” This has sometimes led her to doing intensive preparation, even for minor roles. After three weeks of rehearsals for Doubt, for example, she still wasn’t able to figure out Mrs. Miller. She went home and wrote a hundred-page biography of the character, finally cracking her open after a discussion with a college professor, who explained why a mother would turn a blind eye to a priest abusing her son: She had no other choice. The bigger threat to her son’s well-being was his homophobic father, who might kill him if he found out he was gay. She was protecting her son the only way she knew how."
