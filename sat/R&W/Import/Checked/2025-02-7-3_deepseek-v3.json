        "text": "We became friends back in the day, the only two Black girls in all of Lee Elementary. We were losers. Mostly because we had immigrant mothers who wore bulging scarves around their heads and weren’t afraid to hit or yell at us in public. They sent us to school with saucy, smelly chicken and rice, which ensured we had no friends, because in our part of Florida no one knew how to deal with difference except to hate it. Soon after Best Friend showed up from Kenya with four large piggy tails and pink barrettes, we sat next to each other every day and pretended we spoke the same language. When the kids made fun of us for being weird, we cursed at them in our respective languages, and the teachers wouldn’t say anything because when they tried Best Friend called them racist, the insult her mother told her to use if someone did her wrong. Even after Best Friend realized I understood these kids more than her, that they never asked me questions about living among lions and monkeys, we stuck together, partly out of habit, partly because we liked each other well enough, and partly because we were more like each other than we were like anyone else. We knew how to be mean in a way that was suggestive of love. We knew when to switch to our nice voices, though we didn’t do this often. We sang together, shared our lunch, swapped clothes until our mothers found out and warned us that was a fast track for someone to cast a spell on you."

        "text": "Best Friend lives with her mom and dad in a three-bedroom house in a gated community. In her living room, I sit near the leather sofa and her legs straddle me. I take the hair out of the packaging, cut off the beige rubber band, and hold out a chunk in my palm. I don’t like asking her to do my hair. She thinks I’m embarrassed because I can’t pay her. Really, she just braids too tight. She plucks an inch from the pile in my palm, splits it into two strands, crosses them, and presses them into a small section of my hair with her thumb. I feel the pressure on my scalp, even after she releases it. I wonder: when she pulls my baby hairs into the braid, tucks them beneath a hill of hair, repeats, does she know she hates me, and just how much? Is it finger length? Root length? Or maybe the kind that has no length at all because it never stops growing?"

        "text": "She turns on The Real World, which is all we ever watch these days because it’s good practice for chatting with our new white friends. After Obama got elected, they flocked to her, the white girls who thought she was cool and wanted a cool Black friend so that they could embrace the end of racism in the U.S. We hate them, the girls who used to make fun of our hair and now tell us they love it, who still don’t invite us to their birthday parties because their parents like Black people fine now but only at a distance.<br><br>That’s fine, Best Friend would say, after each non-invite. We’ll throw a better party. If someone doesn’t give a fuck about you, don’t give a fuck about them. Easy.<br><br>I don’t know why she wants new white friends. The only response she’ll give is, They’re easier.<br><br>I think about that sentence a lot. How it’s technically complete, but also cryptic, like it’s missing another half. Than you, she means to add. Than you."

        "text": "Best Friend’s braiding away when she says, I hear David likes you? Dave? She hums so that it’s on me to carry the conversation. We went on a date. Date-ish, I say. And when she doesn’t respond, I add, Maybe a half-date? He didn’t tell you? Dave is Best Friend’s only other real friend. She says, He mentioned he liked you, but I didn’t think he was serious. She digs into my scalp to pull my little hairs into the braid. Before I can say anything, she reroutes. She says, Well I just thought you didn’t like white guys. I don’t, but— And what about Chris? she asks. I can like two guys, I say. I don’t know why I say this. Chris and I have said a total of five words to each other. Before I can take it back, tell her just kidding, she says, So you do like David. Another dig in my scalp, a pulling at the hair. She applies a cool slab of gel to my edges. When I still don’t respond, she says, We had sex, you know. You never told me. She shrugs. If I knew, I tell her, I wouldn’t have— I don’t like him, she says. I was just attracted. Okay, well, I don’t have to— Do what you want, Eden. I’m fine with it. David and I are just friends. Best Friend changes the subject, swift as the next twist, but now my scalp is burning, and I can’t stand it anymore. I say, Could you be easier?, and pull away."

In the floor-length mirror next to the TV, her eyes go cold. I saw that look yesterday during lunch with her fangirls, who talk all the time but don’t say much at all. I told one of them that I liked her earrings. Neon hoops that matched her hair. I stole them from Walmart, she replied. I didn’t know whether she was kidding. All I could think of was the beating I’d get if my mom found out I’d stolen something. Of course, homegirl didn’t stop talking. She said, I don’t even feel bad about it. They treat their workers poorly. Everyone but me and Best Friend vigorously nodded."
