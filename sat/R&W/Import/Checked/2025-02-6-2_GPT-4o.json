        "text": "At the start of the pandemic, my cleaning lady, who worried about us because we are so old, suggested I go to the food bank because it was safer than going grocery shopping. Why would I go to a food bank when I hadn’t lost my job, wasn’t homeless, and could pay for my groceries? She insisted that I would be less likely to catch COVID-19. I’d have no contact with people and could stay sealed in my car. She gave me directions to a church, told me they were the kindest, nicest folks, and that they gave away free turkeys every Thanksgiving. I so desired a free turkey for once in my life. After our last Thanksgiving, my husband said we should no longer buy a turkey for the holiday—it was too heavy for him to handle, too hard for him to carve now that he had a tremor, too much leftover food for just two people. Who of our children would even come to spend Thanksgiving with us? All our daughters were grown, lived far away, and not one would be interested in the little chocolate turkeys I used to buy them at See’s Candies."

        "text": "I drove the two miles to the food bank at the church—really just one left turn from our street onto the road that goes from our house to the magnificent golden cross at the church’s entrance. WELCOME—YOU MUST WEAR A MASK, the sign read, and I joined the orderly line of supplicants winding their way through the parking lot in a colorful parade of cars. Among them I noted a BMW, a red Mercedes, and a Humvee. A pretty woman at a table greeted each car, one by one. She talked briefly to every driver, and typed something into a small computer. When I got to her, she took my name but didn’t ask me if I were poor or homeless, and placed on my windshield a little card that read ONE SPECIAL ITEM FIRST VISIT.<br><br>“Have a great day,” she told me, “and God bless.”<br><br>When I arrived at a temporary stop sign, an older man bent toward me and kindly asked, “How many families and where do you want the food? Back seat or trunk?” I told him one family, trunk. He wrote 1-T on my windshield in white marker. I drove forward and noticed a swarm of volunteers wearing bright orange vests hurrying to the open trunk of the car ahead of me, each person carrying a carton, or a gallon jug of milk, or a bag of vegetables (some celery stalks sticking out the top), or a lumpy, foil-wrapped object, shaped, I thought, like a frozen chicken. One female volunteer was smiling as she deposited a bag into the car ahead. A young man with powerful arms was loading a large sealed box into the trunk. On its side was printed LOS ANGELES REGIONAL FOOD BANK and under it the words FIGHTING HUNGER. GIVING HOPE.<br><br>My turn now. I stopped, I felt vibrations behind me as my trunk door was raised, and a series of thumps shook my car. The trunk was gently closed; the man wiped the white letters off my windshield, gave me a thumbs-up, and I drove off."

        "text": "Only to stop at one more station. A woman about my age came to my open car window and said, “How can I help you? Baby diapers? Wet wipes? Formula? Hand sanitizer? Masks? Dog food?”<br><br>“I don’t have a dog.” She looked at me closely. “Maxi pads? At my age I have to use them, maybe you can use some too.” Then she astonished me by extending her closed fist through the open window toward me, and I automatically extended mine, and we fist-bumped. “Friends!” she announced. She handed me some carefully wrapped portions of maxi pads. “See you next week, my friend,” she said. I drove home, somewhat stunned but aware that I was smiling."

        "text": "When I opened my trunk in the garage, I felt a rare excitement—a kind of delight that a surprise awaited me, as on a special birthday. I carried a bag of potatoes into the house and asked my husband to help with the rest. The gallon of milk was too heavy for me. The carton, also. We put all the food on the kitchen table.<br><br>A beautiful chocolate layer cake, which I guessed was my special first visit item, showed an expiration date of two days ago, but I was certain it was perfect. Someone had also placed in my trunk an orchid plant in a red plastic pot. It was mostly wilted, but it still had a few floppy purple flowers hanging off a stem. How kind someone was to do this for me. Even imperfect beauty raised my spirits. In the big carton were bags of rice and beans, a box of spaghetti, cans of tuna, chicken and soup, jars of peanut butter. We unpacked the various bags and found a bottle of cooking oil, a pound of butter, apples, walnuts, carrots, onions. Other gifts I discovered included a can labeled LIQUID DEATH, a bottle of dark-truffle ketchup, a six-pack of caramel-pumpkin yogurt, and a package of wild sardines in hot jalapeño sauce.<br><br>“Do we really need all this?” my husband asked.<br><br>“Do we need to eat?” I replied."
