        "text": "The best vaqueros have “cow sense,” the innate understanding of the way cattle think and move. They are masters of the lasso and ride as one with a horse. But one of the most important qualities of a good vaquero is the willingness to teach his skills."

        "text": "In 1968, Samuel Torres Sr. was a caporal at Alta Vista, the headquarters of the original Jones family ranches that once spanned more than 300,000 acres between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River. His sons, Samuel Torres Jr. (Sammy) and Gerardo Torres (Jerry), lived for the days he would take them to roundups. They’d pick out their clothes and put their spurs on their boots, and by three a.m. they’d be heading to the camp house a mile or two from the main ranch. The cook had coffee going, plus beans, pan de campo, and tortillas. While they ate, they could hear the distant thundering of horses. The remuda was coming in, up to 300 horses being brought from the pasture by two remuderos, brothers Felipe and Miguel Piñon. By five-thirty, the men—and boys—were saddling up."

        "text": "On most large ranches, roundups happened twice a year, once in the spring to brand, vaccinate, and castrate calves and colts and once in the fall to cull cattle for market. Torres Sr. was a patient teacher, not just to his sons but to other young vaqueros, including Jose “Red” García Jr. García was used to learning on the job. The first time he castrated a horse, a vaquero had told him, “You’ve seen enough—now do it.” But Torres Sr. took eighteen-year-old García under his wing, explaining which two vaqueros to keep in sight and which landmarks to look out for to maintain his position when driving cattle."

        "text": "Marty Alegria, who was born on King Ranch in 1966, also benefited from mentorship by legendary vaqueros. Chief among them were Kineños Alberto “Lolo” Treviño, whose ancestry goes back to the de la Garza family who owned the land before King purchased it, and Martín Mendietta, a fifth-generation Kineño and caporal. Alegria grew up in a Kineño colony of about one hundred brick houses and spent weekends and school holidays alongside old vaqueros who would teach the children how to rope, ride, and break horses as well as how to read cows and people. Eventually, Alegria graduated to working big corridas with thirty other vaqueros, gathering thousands of head of cattle on pastures up to 10,000 acres."

        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "The best thing Alegria learned in his forty-one-year career at King Ranch, he says, is how to palpate cattle to check for pregnancy and ensure high-percentage calf crops each year. With intricate knowledge of the cow’s reproductive system, Alegria can tell whether the animal is pregnant as early as thirty-five days after conception, when the embryo is only nine to ten millimeters long. Over the course of his career, he has palpated upwards of 280,000 head of cattle. Alegria’s eagerness to pass his knowledge on to fellow vaqueros is how he measures his success. “I ain’t gonna take this to my grave,” he says."

        "text": "Any conversation about the legacy of Texas vaqueros must contend with difficult truths. The first is vaqueros’ general erasure from cowboy mythology. In her introduction to Voices from the Wild Horse Desert, Ana Carolina Castillo Crimm notes that a history of King Ranch published in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times in 1953, which describes the lives of the Anglo foremen in detail, neglects to mention the Kineños at all."

        "text": "This isn’t a coincidence. The Mexican Revolution, between 1910 and 1919, led to a spell of deadly anti-Mexican sentiment. The border became militarized, and the Texas Rangers grew from a small militia group to an official law enforcement agency that targeted “both the ‘Indian warrior’ and the Mexican vaquero as enemies of white supremacy,” the historian Monica Muñoz Martinez writes in her book The Injustice Never Leaves You. National political cartoons portrayed Mexicans as revolutionaries and bandits, and this is how they came to be depicted in most Western literature and film, opposite the noble white American cowboy. Notable exceptions are the 1972 photo book Vaquero: Genesis of the Texas Cowboy by Bill Wittliff, founder of the Wittliff Collections at Texas State University, and the 1958 book With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero by the Texas folklorist Américo Paredes."

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "“Mexican vaqueros have largely been erased from Texas popular memory because they provide a picture of a Mexican that contrasts with racist depictions of them as unskilled, uneducated, dangerous, and a threat,” Muñoz Martinez says. “To tell the history of the vaquero you also have to tell the history of a long effort to displace Mexicans from economic, cultural, and political power in South Texas.”"

        "text": "To Muñoz Martinez’s point, vaqueros have never been paid commensurate with their skill or the importance of their contributions to the cattle industry. “It’s not going to make you rich,” Alegria says. Indeed, in the 1940s, Pedro Buentello made $25 a month, one-eighth the median U.S. income. In the 1970s, García made $175 per month, one-fifth the median U.S. income, per the U.S. Census Bureau. The most Buentello ever made was $1,200 a month in the 1980s. Until recently, there was no pension or retirement plan for vaqueros. They simply worked until the work changed. At King Ranch, when a vaquero got too old to ride horses, he would inspect fences or fill water barrels, chop wood or teach the children, like Alegria, and pass the tradition forward. Stories abound about vaqueros whose hearts gave out the day they could no longer work, as if broken by the loss of life on the range."

        "text": "The model of lifelong work on a ranch began to change in the mid-1970s when helicopters started being used for roundups. Pilots were paired with old vaqueros and, without headphones to communicate, would rely on their body language for clues: if the vaquero winced or turned, the helicopter was getting too close or pushing too hard. Once the pilots learned how to herd cattle from the sky, they became known as helicopter cowboys. For $200 to $350 an hour, a helicopter might take half a day to gather a pasture that would take thirty vaqueros two days."
