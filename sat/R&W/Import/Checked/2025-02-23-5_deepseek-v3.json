        "text": "My mother heard about the OKI robbery shortly after it happened. In 1993, she was thirty years old. She ran a small company called Aristocrat Inc. that bought and sold computer chips, routing surpluses from suppliers to companies that needed them. She was married and living in Cupertino, just a few streets away from where McMahon grew up. In June of that year, she had given birth to a second daughter. I was two at the time. From the outside, there was nothing extraordinary about her: she was just an Asian immigrant working in the technology sector in the Bay Area."

        "text": "Working in the computer industry had been a matter of time, place, and opportunity for my mother. Unlike her husband, my father, who was an engineer working on inkjet printers at Hewlett-Packard, she was not among the class of highly educated immigrants that accounted for nearly one-third of the Bay Area’s scientific and engineering workforce in 1990. Those immigrants, like my father, had come to the States in the eighties for grad school, after which they were routed directly into tech companies in Silicon Valley. This was a fairly common if not archetypal route to ensuring a steady and often sizable income, which could then fulfill the promise of upward socioeconomic mobility."

        "text": "My mother, on the other hand, was not an engineer and in many ways was the antithesis of the stereotypical straight-A-earning Asian student. She had scored abysmally on the SATs and majored in studio art at Cal State, Long Beach. She was vocationally unequipped in a way that made any version of the immigrant success story seem completely out of reach for her. But by 1993, her knowledge of computer chips had swelled to an encyclopedic level. She knew the exact makes and models of the new chips on the market and how much they were worth. She knew where to buy them and where to sell them. And most important, she knew how to make a profit off them. My parents always joked that my father was book-smart, but my mother was street-smart. While my father ruled by logic and reason, my mother led with intuition and honed instincts."

        "text": "My mother is a petite woman at five feet, three inches tall. A friend who recently met her described her as 'smiley and effervescent.' For my entire life, she’s maintained the exact same haircut, one that is somewhat universal among Asian moms: a chin-length bob with the ends curled in, always parted on the left side. Her hair—which is jet-black like mine, thick, with very few grays even now, at fifty-nine—frames full, youthful cheeks and dark, almond-shaped eyes, whose lids are tattooed with permanent eyeliner (for the sake of convenience, she has said). Her demure appearance belies the fact that she possesses the kind of boldness, persuasiveness, and doggedness that make her a force to be reckoned with, both as a mother and as a person of the world."

        "text": "As a child, I was embarrassed by those traits. At airplane ticket counters and in restaurants, she could talk her way from clerk to manager, never afraid to ask for the impossible. In foreign countries she approached strangers for directions without pause and could curry the goodwill of a bus driver with whom she did not share a language, solely through gestures and charm. Once, when I was stuck in Florence, Italy, during a terrible snowstorm, all the taxis had stopped running, and I was left without a ride to the airport. I phoned my mother. Hours later, she called back: a middle-aged Italian housewife was on her way to pick me up in a minivan. In a culture that portrayed Asian American women as docile, passive, and shy, my mother was an anomaly. She had the daring of a free climber and the savviness of a salesperson. Who’s to say if this was constitutional or the developed character of an immigrant trying to survive?"

        "text": "Born in Taipei, Taiwan, in the sixties, my mother moved to Orange County in Los Angeles with her family when she was sixteen. In 1971, the United Nations had voted to admit the People’s Republic of China, thereby ousting Taiwan from its cohort. This worried my grandparents, who feared that China might try to take over Taiwan. Around the same time, her brother, Richard, had been expelled from several Taiwanese schools for bad behavior; immigrating to America was a last-ditch effort to reform him. Richard was my mother’s Irish twin, born 356 days before her. My mother attributes her fearlessness to him; as an uber-athletic, ultra-mischievous child, he would coerce my mother into scrambling over fences and sneaking into neighbors’ yards to steal their fruit."

        "text": "When my mother arrived in America, she spoke little English. There were no ESL courses at her school, so instead she was held back a grade and put in a class with the delinquent kids, the ones who, according to her, showed up to class barefoot, blasting music from their portable stereos. After school, she washed dishes and chopped raw meat at her uncle’s Chinese restaurant in exchange for her family’s room and board. 'You are the girl. You have to stay in the kitchen,' she remembers being told. 'I was very isolated. It was a very lonely time.' In Taiwan she had wanted to be a journalist, but in America that dream was no longer tenable. Instead, while she was in college at Cal State, Long Beach, she heard about a part-time job as a receptionist at a company called Delta Lu Electronics in Cerritos. My mom didn’t care what the job was. She needed the money, so she applied."

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "In 1984, the year my mother started at Delta Lu, the PC industry was on the rise. The year commenced with Apple’s launch of the Macintosh computer during a Ridley Scott–directed Super Bowl commercial wherein a Princess Di doppelgänger in running shorts throws a sledgehammer at Big Brother to free a mass of blue-gray-garbed drones from technocratic dominance. This was Apple’s proclamation that the Mac would save everyone from the dystopia rendered in George Orwell’s 1984—the irony of which should not escape anybody. That same year, CD-ROMs were the new hot technology, Dell and Cisco were just getting started, and Bill Gates appeared on the cover of Time magazine with a floppy disk balanced on his index finger. In Southern California, an enterprising immigrant named Don Lu, eager to ride this wave of technological innovation, began importing memory chips, keyboards, graphics cards, monitors, and motherboards from Japan and Taiwan. Companies and individuals were building their own PCs and needed the parts. As his company grew, he needed a receptionist. So he hired my mother for five dollars an hour."

        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "Delta Lu Electronics was what we might now call a start-up, and because of its fledgling nature, my mother’s job description continually shifted and expanded. She was shuffled between departments, through accounting and returns, learning the ropes of the entire business as she went. After about a year she was promoted to a sales position in a new company called Byte Resources, and unsurprisingly, she became very good at her job: she was keenly attuned to people’s needs and deft at negotiations. While the average salesperson might turn away a customer when they didn’t have a part on hand, my mother never did. Instead, she’d say, 'Let me see what I can do for you,' and would call around to suppliers until she found exactly what the customer needed. Then she’d smartly quote a higher price and make a sale. She wasn’t the type of person who needed permission, and in her eyes, anything was possible with a little extra effort."

        "text": "My parents got married in August of 1987 after meeting at a party in Long Beach. My mother was twenty-four, my father twenty-seven. After a year and a half at Byte Resources, my mother quit her job to move with her new husband to the Bay Area, where he was starting in the Optoelectronics Division at Hewlett-Packard in San Jose. After growing up in Hong Kong and attending university in England, he’d arrived in California to get a PhD in electrical engineering at Caltech. Now he was working on semiconductors in Silicon Valley. In the middle-class suburbs where I grew up, many Asian parents, mostly Taiwanese, Chinese, and Indian, did the same. They worked at companies like IBM, Intel, and AMD and sent their kids to the best public schools in Cupertino and San Jose."
