        "text": "One night we drive to the Casa De La Juventud, a winsomely run-down gym just down the road. The night is windy and damp, rain on the way. Paul is building his own gym nearby, but for now this place is at the heart of his whole project."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "The place has a bracing physicality. Outside, the sea wind breaks against the squat walls; while the trees overhead nod obligingly, tires from the car bringing his sparring partners turn slowly on the asphalt, the same sound as unrolling athletic tape for his hands. The gym lights glow sulfur in the threshold, from which petrichor seeps inside, volatiles perking up in response to the wet air, what you never remember insisting on itself again, the fibrous, dense tension of things, you can nearly draw your finger against it—real life."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "No wonder he’s given himself over to the sport—its rituals are a direct repudiation of everything he thinks of already at the age of twenty-four as his old life. Here he records only for himself; here every action is purposeful, significant, every mistake punished."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "An industrial fan in the back doorway growls on, fails to allay the dank heat but instead covers all other sounds in a maternal way—a mollifying drone sharply repealed when the action starts. Watching Paul spar his diminutive opponents emphasizes a fact he has used to his advantage in his three previous bouts: he has yet to fight anyone his own size. Up close Paul is broad, thick limbed and, at around six feet, deceptively tall. Flores says he will come down from just over 200 pounds to make the fight’s 190-pound catchweight limit against Woodley, who is five-nine and has fought at the 170-pound welterweight limit in the UFC for years. Flores envisions Paul competing against cruiserweights at the 200-pound limit eventually."

        "text": "Paul goes six rounds—it is late in the week and early in camp, so the workload is moderate—against two different fighters, one an experienced journeyman useful for keeping Paul technically honest and the other young, energetic Anthony Taylor, who will face off against Tommy Fury on Paul’s Showtime undercard in Cleveland."

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Bidarian reached out to Showtime Sports EVP Stephen Espinoza after Paul vs. Askren’s reported 1.4 million PPV buys, no matter how disputed, proved that Paul was a lucrative talent. Espinoza and his staff went to work, doing their homework on Paul’s history, and Espinoza had several long conversations with him via Zoom. He was impressed with Paul’s boxing knowledge, his commitment to training and improvement, and his marketing acumen. The obvious thing happened—money won."

        "text": "Espinoza is one of the headiest entertainment executives in the world. Seeing the influx of influencer boxing, legacy exhibitions, and boxing-MMA crossovers, which he helped pioneer with the towering financial returns of Mayweather vs. McGregor, he sees his business as now existing in three genres: “We’ve got the championship-level fights. We’ve got ShoBox, the developmental series, and this is sort of a separate element of the business that is obviously still within the same sport but different from what we’ve been doing.… I’ve struggled for a name. I have to be very clear. These are competitive fights. They’re not exhibitions. They’re not influencer events. These are legitimate competitive sanctioned boxing events where there’s going to be a winner or loser. The difference is it’s neither fish nor fowl.”"

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Whether Paul’s union with Showtime signals the immanent or imminent death of boxing is beyond my ken. I have heard and read boxing declared dead so many times it can come to feel like a zombie sport, sometimes near the pulsing heart of the culture and sometimes enfeebled and at the margins."

      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "I ask Espinoza if the April sexual assault accusation against Paul played a role in his decision. “There certainly were some candid conversations about everything, about things that have been reported and things that haven’t,” Espinoza says, adding that Paul categorically denied the allegation. “If we were not convinced that Jake was mature enough and committed to being a positive representation of our boxing program, then we wouldn’t be in business with him.”"

      {
        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "On April 9, Paradise accused Paul, in detail, of forced oral sex. A follow-up New York Times story said Paradise told three friends immediately what had happened, and they corroborated her story and that she plans to file charges. Paul insists he has never made any sexual contact with Paradise and further that the screen grabs of text messages between them are fake. I was unable to reach Paradise for further comment for this story. Paul declines to answer whether he will pursue charges of defamation he threatened in his statement denying the accusation."
