        "text": "This undertaking underscores how easy it is for prisons to hide the true reason why people die behind bars and how useless the existing data are for determining whether people in prison are dying from preventable conditions. The overwhelming difficulty of the task raises questions about whether and how family members or community advocates could ever use the information to sound the alarm about especially dangerous facilities, help families and friends figure out if a death was preventable, or pinpoint inadequate care for certain diseases."

        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "By law, states are supposed to record the details of every death that occurs in prison. The Death in Custody Reporting Act, a federal law on the books for more than twenty years, requires states to fill out a four-page form that lays out basic information about every incarcerated person’s death, including the name, age, and ethnicity of each person who died and their cause of death."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "The Department of Justice uses those data to compile high-level reports about deaths in prison, but the data are often reported at such a macro level that it’s not useful. Those reports, for example, only provide a tally of how many people die of 'liver disease,' which could have been caused by everything from hepatitis A, B, and C to liver damage from alcohol use."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "When Stat filed public record requests seeking the information, states gave multiple reasons for hiding it. Arizona, for example, said it didn’t maintain death data in the format Stat requested. When Stat sent a follow-up request demanding the exact forms the state already submits to the federal government, the state then said it couldn’t provide those documents because they were owned by the Department of Justice. (Other states provided the exact same forms.)"

(Other states provided the exact same forms.)<br><br>Arkansas is one of several states that declined to provide Stat with any data at all because the state’s records law doesn’t require it to provide data to out-of-state residents. (Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson wrote the Death in Custody Reporting Act when he was in the U.S. House of Representatives.)<br><br>Other states, like Texas and Alaska, told Stat the forms they are required to submit to the federal government simply don’t exist. Texas added that it doesn’t have access to the forms because they’re submitted via a 'data upload.'"

        "text": "Iowa said the information was confidential. Others, like Connecticut and Georgia, simply ignored Stat’s request altogether, in clear violation of public records laws.<br><br>Some states, like Indiana, shared data that were largely useless: The state only categorizes deaths as 'homicide,' 'use of force,' 'suicide,' 'accident,' or 'natural causes,' making it nearly impossible to assess the adequacy of the prison medical system there."

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "In fact, Stat was only able to document the number of people who died of hepatitis C after crafting an agreement with the federal government to analyze the death data submitted by state prisons pursuant to the federal Death In Custody Reporting Act. That data is housed at the University of Michigan and is typically only available to Ph.D. researchers who are approved by the Department of Justice—an option unavailable to the average American. For our research, the DOJ withheld names and other demographic information."

        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "Even those data were highly imperfect. Often, they were not detailed enough to discern whether someone died of hepatitis C. We excluded any such death from our tally, meaning it is likely an undercount of the actual death toll from this disease.<br><br>Prisons are only required to submit one cause of death to the federal government. What that means in practice is that a person who died of a hemorrhage due to hepatitis C–induced bleeding is often listed as dying of a hemorrhage, making it impossible to know if that bleeding was caused by something like hepatitis C or a homicide."

        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "The problem is especially acute when it comes to hepatitis C–induced liver cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly 50 percent of liver cancer cases are attributable to hepatitis C, but prisons across the country only report when people die of liver cancer, not what actually caused the cancer. Stat counted 416 deaths since 2014 that listed liver cancer as the cause of death with no additional causes; those are not included in our count of 1,013 hepatitis C–related deaths in prison."
