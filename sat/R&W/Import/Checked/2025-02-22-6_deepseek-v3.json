        "text": "Long before humans heated up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, shifts in climate shaped the course of life on Earth. Over the past 2.6 million years, roughly 30 percent of Earth’s surface became encrusted in ice, then thawed, then froze again—around 20 times. Just about all species on Earth were shaped by these cycles. Many wouldn’t exist if their ancestors hadn’t found refugia."

        "text": "The term climate refugia emerged from paleoecology, the study of how plants and animals interact with their environment and one another over time. For hundreds of years, scientists have debated the reason for the incredible diversity of species on Earth. Why, for example, do we see eighteen species of macaw in the Amazon rainforest instead of just one? While Darwin’s theory of evolution supplied a broad intellectual framework for speciation, it left many of the details unanswered. In the 1960s, some researchers proposed refugia as a possible answer. They hypothesized that during ice ages, species had escaped to pockets that remained hospitable. In refugia, plants and animals continued to thrive until the climate warmed once more and they were able to fan out across the landscape again. These periods of isolation allowed plant and animal populations to evolve separately, until they were no longer the same species. The role of refugia in these species’ survival is written into their genes."

        "text": "Around the turn of the millennium, climate refugia began to be used in the context of climate change wrought by humans. As scientists began warning the public about global warming, some also started to wonder where plants and animals might have the best shot at survival. But they had no way of precisely projecting into the future, said Carlos Carroll, an ecologist at the Klamath Center for Conservation Research. In the early 2000s, researchers got a new chest of tools: computer programs that could analyze myriad variables about the environment, from topography to soil composition, and better calculate the future of the climate in a particular region in more granular detail."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "These models presented scientists with a new understanding: “The stress from climate change, the level of risk to species and ecosystems, is not uniform across regions; it varies quite a bit,” Carroll said. “That was the key finding.”"

        "text": "But what gets classified as climate refugia? Bumblebees in Europe and chipmunks in Yosemite are seeking cooler climates at higher elevations. For some scientists, that alone is enough to qualify a mountaintop as a climate refuge. Others disagree. After all, where will those plants and animals go when even those mountaintops become too warm? For Toni Lyn Morelli, a research ecologist with the US Geological Survey’s Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, refugia are places where the climate will change very slowly, or won’t change at all."

        "text": "Take Devils Postpile National Monument, in a valley in the central Sierra Nevada. Even in the heat of summer, the meadows in the valley remain chilly—as much as 18 degrees cooler than the 10,000-foot peaks around them. A phenomenon called cold-air pooling provides a buffer against heat waves. During the day, as heat rises, cold, moist air settles to the valley bottom. Meanwhile, the steep walls of the monument prevent sunlight from warming that air, so the coolness gets locked in. Across the globe, other refugia form around steep slopes that face the poles—the lack of sunlight means that these areas warm less readily. Deep lakes and coastlines form their own refugia, with some areas absorbing heat while others stay cool."

        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "The harsh reality is that it might not make sense to invest limited resources in protecting environments where species will no longer be able to survive. “There’s much, much more work to do than we have resources,” Morelli said. That work includes removing invasive species and reducing humans’ impact. It might even include moving vulnerable species to refugia."

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Assisted migration is not without controversy. Some land managers are concerned that newly introduced species will edge out native species, or that newly established populations will eventually blink out on land they haven’t evolved to inhabit. Alexis Mychajliw, a paleoecologist at Middlebury College, points out that plants and animals aren’t stationary beings, and during past climate change events, they moved themselves. “The history of most species is movement,” Mychajliw said. “When the climate changes, they tend to follow those conditions.” The sheer pace of human-caused climate change, plus the barriers posed by roads, fences, and subdivisions, make that natural pattern of movement impossible. So why not give species a hand if we know where they might have a better shot at survival?"

        "text": "In 2017, ecologists at the National Park Service introduced a cohort of threatened red-legged frogs into Yosemite after identifying areas of the park as likely refugia. The species once lived throughout California but is now limited to pockets across the state. Whether the site of the frogs’ introduction was ever a part of their original range is contested, said Andrea Adams, a research scientist at Washington State University, but today, the red-legged frogs are thriving in Yosemite. Adams considers it a conservation success."

        "text": "It’s possible that a similar strategy might save the foothill yellow-legged frog, but first, land managers need to know where the climate refugia are. That’s where Claudia Mengelt comes in.<br><br>Mengelt, an oceanographer turned land manager, had never heard the term refugia until she stumbled upon Morelli’s research while working at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC. Mengelt, who is now the program manager of land management research at the US Geological Survey, was immediately intrigued. Because of the fluid, dynamic nature of ocean environments, marine conservation tends to embrace the inevitability of change and movement, so the idea of climate adaptation felt natural to Mengelt—a fish out of water among frog biologists. By the time she met Morelli in person, Mengelt had moved out West and taken on a new project: developing a conservation plan for the foothill yellow-legged frog."
