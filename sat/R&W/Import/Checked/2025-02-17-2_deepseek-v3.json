        "text": "More Americans have been killed by the new coronavirus than the influenza pandemic of 1918, despite a century of intervening medical advancement. The United States was ranked first among nations in pandemic preparedness but has among the highest death rates in the industrialized world. It invests more in medical care than any comparable country, but its hospitals have been overwhelmed. It helped develop COVID-19 vaccines at near-miraculous and record-breaking speed, but its vaccination rates plateaued so quickly that it is now thirty-eighth in the world. COVID-19 revealed that the United States, despite many superficial strengths, is alarmingly vulnerable to new diseases—and such diseases are inevitable. As the global population grows, as the climate changes, and as humans push into spaces occupied by wild animals, future pandemics become more likely. We are not guaranteed the luxury of facing just one a century or even one at a time."

        "text": "It might seem ridiculous to think about future pandemics now, as the United States is consumed by debates over booster shots, reopened schools, and vaccine mandates. Prepare for the next one? Let’s get through this one first! But America must do both together, precisely because of the cycle that Fee and Brown bemoaned. Today’s actions are already writing the opening chapters of the next pandemic’s history."

        "text": "Internationally, Joe Biden has made several important commitments. At the United Nations General Assembly last week, he called for a new council of national leaders and a new international fund, both focused on infectious threats—forward-looking measures that experts had recommended well before COVID-19."

        "text": "But domestically, many public-health experts, historians, and legal scholars worry that the United States is lapsing into neglect, that the temporary wave of investments isn’t being channeled into the right areas, and that COVID-19 might actually leave the United States weaker against whatever emerges next. Donald Trump’s egregious mismanagement made it easy to believe that events would have played out differently with a halfway-competent commander who executed preexisting pandemic plans. But that ignores the many vulnerabilities that would have made the United States brittle under any administration. Even without Trump, 'we’d still have been in a whole lot of trouble,' Gregg Gonsalves, a global-health activist and an epidemiologist at Yale, told me. 'The weaknesses were in the rootstock, not high up in the trees.'"

        "text": "The panic-neglect cycle is not inevitable but demands recognition and resistance. 'A pandemic is a course correction to the trajectory of civilization,' Alex de Waal, of Tufts University and the author of New Pandemics, Old Politics, told me. 'Historical pandemics challenged us to make some fairly fundamental changes to the way in which society is organized.' Just as cholera forced our cities to be rebuilt for sanitation, COVID-19 should make us rethink the way we ventilate our buildings, as my colleague Sarah Zhang argued. But beyond overhauling its physical infrastructure, the United States must also address its deep social weaknesses—a health-care system that millions can’t access, a public-health system that’s been rotting for decades, and extreme inequities that leave large swaths of society susceptible to a new virus."

        "text": "Early last year, some experts suggested to me that America’s COVID-19 failure stemmed from its modern inexperience with infectious disease; having now been tested, it might do better next time. But preparedness doesn’t come automatically, and neither does its absence. 'Katrina didn’t happen because Louisiana never had a hurricane before; it happened because of policy choices that led to catastrophe,' Gonsalves said. The arc of history does not automatically bend toward preparedness. It must be bent."

        "text": "On September 3, the White House announced a new strategy to prepare for future pandemics. Drafted by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Council, the plan would cost the United States $65 billion over the next seven to ten years. In return, the country would get new vaccines, medicines, and diagnostic tests; new ways of spotting and tracking threatening pathogens; better protective equipment and replenished stockpiles; sturdier supply chains; and a centralized mission control that would coordinate all the above across agencies. The plan, in rhetoric and tactics, resembles those that were written before COVID-19 and never fully enacted. It seems to suggest all the right things."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "But the response from the health experts I’ve talked with has been surprisingly mixed. 'It’s underwhelming,' Mike Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, told me. 'That $65 billion should have been a down payment, not the entire program. It’s a rounding error for our federal budget, and yet our entire existence going forward depends on this.' The pandemic plan compares itself to the Apollo program, but the government spent four times as much, adjusted for inflation, to put astronauts on the Moon. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic may end up costing the United States an estimated $16 trillion."

        "text": "'I completely agree that it will take more investment,' Eric Lander, OSTP director and Biden’s science adviser, told me; he noted that the published plan is just one element of a broader pandemic-preparedness effort that is being developed. But even the $65 billion that the plan has called for might not fully materialize. Biden originally wanted to ask Congress to immediately invest $30 billion but eventually called for just half that amount, in a compromise with moderate Democrats who sought to slash it even further. The idea of shortchanging pandemic preparedness after the events of 2020 'should be unthinkable,' wrote the former CDC Director Tom Frieden and the former Senator Tom Daschle in The Hill. But it is already happening."

        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "Others worry about the way the budget is being distributed. About $24 billion has been earmarked for technologies that can create vaccines against a new virus within one hundred days. Another $12 billion will go toward new antiviral drugs, and $5 billion toward diagnostic tests. These goals are, individually, sensible enough. But devoting two-thirds of the full budget toward them suggests that COVID-19’s lessons haven’t been learned.<br><br>America failed to test sufficiently throughout the pandemic even though rigorous tests have long been available. Antiviral drugs played a bit part because they typically provide incremental benefits over basic medical care and can be overly expensive even when they work. And vaccines were already produced far faster than experts had estimated and were more effective than they had hoped; accelerating that process won’t help if people can’t or won’t get vaccinated and especially if they equate faster development with nefarious corner-cutting, as many Americans did this year. Every adult in the United States has been eligible for vaccines since mid-April; in that time, more Americans have died of COVID-19 per capita than people in Germany, Canada, Rwanda, Vietnam, or more than 130 other countries did in the prevaccine era."
