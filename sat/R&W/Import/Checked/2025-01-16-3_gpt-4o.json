      "text": "Woof isn’t the only well-being platform making inroads in Danish schools. Platforms like Bloomsights, Moods, and Klassetrivsel (Danish for \u201cclassroom well-being\u201d) are also getting traction. Each takes a more data-intensive and less anonymous approach than Woof, tracking and identifying schoolchildren individually. Bloomsights and Klassetrivsel even go as far as generating \u201csociograms\u201d\u2014network diagrams that display the children\u2019s relationships with each other in detail."

      "text": "Bloomsights turns self-reported data from the same individuals over time into indicators including \u201csigns of loneliness,\u201d \u201cacadmic mindset,\u201d and \u201csigns of bullying.\u201d Bloomsights is also used in the US, where some school districts are including it as part of an \u201cearly warning system\u201d for identifying potential school shooters. The company\u2019s US operations are based in Colorado. Cofounder Adam Rockenbach says the hope in bringing Bloomsights to the US was to spread the Scandinavian values of well-being and community. He asserts that the app is not meant to be a dystopian \u201cBig Brother\u201d but an extension of what teachers already do."

      "text": "\u201cYou notice the student is coming into class, and maybe they\u2019re coming to class late more frequently than before, and they look a little disheveled,\u201d he says. \u201cA good teacher is going to go find two or three minutes to connect with that student: \u2018Hey, it seems like there\u2019s something off here. Is there any way I can help you?\u2019\u201d Citing his experiences as a teacher in inner-city schools in Los Angeles for six years, Rockenbach says it can be a challenge to know what is really going on with children who struggle in an environment that might be marked by gang violence and poverty. He says Bloomsights can help in situations where the signals are not so clear."

      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "Rockenbach believes that anonymous data only makes early intervention more difficult, since it creates more work for teachers and educators in trying to identify who has problems and needs help. For this reason, he thinks collecting individual data is a necessity. The program, which operates through a web app, takes self-reporting measurements similar to Woof\u2019s: monthly surveys of students, measuring various indicators of mental and physical well-being and students\u2019 evaluation of their learning environment."
