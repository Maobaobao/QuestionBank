      "text": "Konrad Hartman slept with one eye open. I asked him once why his eye did that. He said one time he was helping Kathleen hang curtains in the front room, and she was up on the ladder with a cigarette in her mouth, like always. In his German accent, as if his thick lips were too relaxed to participate, he explained, “She dropped the hot ash right in my eye. It burnt my eye and now it don’t close.” Then he smiled like it was nothing. But in the scene my mind created, he hollered, smacked the ladder, and Kathleen teetered in the air."

      "text": "Konrad often came home late at night and slept most of the morning, but not through breakfast because the trailer was so small—the kitchen table where we ate stood just a couple of feet away from him sleeping there on the sofa. So he’d get up and eat with Kathleen and me, leaning on his meaty forearms, drooping forward over his eggs and bacon as if his back was still sleeping. Then he’d return to sleep on the sofa for the rest of the morning. When I’d come through the door from playing outside, I’d see that eye looking all white like it was dead, or sometimes moving like it was searching for something while he slept. When I was six, it was the creepiest thing I’d ever seen."

      "text": "I asked Konny, which is what I called him, a lot of questions. I talked to him more than to most other adults on account of the hour-long ride from my house in the city to Kathleen and Konny’s trailer in Dennings Orchard Trailer Court. He would come to get me in his big blue Lincoln after his shift managing the pet store. On the drive, we talked about my school, about why bunnies’ noses wiggle, and why somebody chose red, yellow, and green for the traffic lights. We talked about everything. He didn’t seem to mind my talking, and didn’t turn the radio on or say he was too busy, the way other adults did. When Konny stepped on the brake, he always put his arm out to keep me from sliding off the seat."

      "text": "Kathleen wasn’t really Konny’s wife. My mother called her his “common-law wife,” which I understood to mean they had not stood before a minister or anyone else in charge of such things, but they considered themselves married anyway. Kathleen had probably lived at our house longer than she’d lived in the trailer with Konny. She became my nanny when my baby nurse, Mrs. Tenney, left, around the time I was a year old, and stayed until I turned six. Kathleen made sure I brushed my teeth while I stood on the little stool in the bathroom, put barrettes in my hair, and shined my Mary Jane shoes with Jubilee. She cooked my meals and when she made something special, she let me lick the spoon. At night, Kathleen bathed me, on her knees beside the tub, and blew giant soap bubbles by making an O with her thumb and fingers. When it was time for bedtime stories, she used a magnifying glass because her eyes were so bad that even her Coke-bottle-thick glasses weren’t enough. I thought everyone read that way, and when I started to read by myself, I looked for and used her magnifier. Her lap was the only one I can recall sitting on and it felt doughy-soft and smelled like baby powder. Her long gray hair crossed over her head in two plaits and sometimes she let me put the bobby pins in. Kathleen’s room was off our upstairs hall and had a twin bed, a tall dresser, and a reading chair, which was all that would fit. But when I was six, my parents moved to a new, more modern house where there wasn’t a room for her anymore and she left us to go live with Konny in the trailer."
