        "text": "If I believed in omens, I’d say the shotgun incident was the worst of omens, literary in its foreshadowing. We can smell a hint of devastation, can’t we, a scent we can’t quite recognize on first whiff but turn our noses away from knowingly. Where will our characters end up? Our armed protagonist? The girl who tells the story? When I began writing this essay I wanted it to be about fate—how two black kids raised by the same working-class parents could have radically different life outcomes because, as fate would have it, divergent occurrences compel divergent paths. Bruce never went back to the high school with the bullying boys. He dropped out. It’s around this time that my parents got a call in the middle of the night that Bruce was in custody at the local precinct for being caught in a stolen car. It was the 1970s and no charges were pressed, boys being boys. That night, my father beat my brother mercilessly with a washing machine hose in the dank basement of our house. The chaos of a violence like that is astonishing. The cacophonous screaming. The inability of anyone to stop it. The cold pallor that hangs in the air afterward. A chasm emerged between us—me, floating off like some wandering balloon; my brother tethered tightly to a familiar story of trouble and poverty, like most of the kids in our neighborhood."

        "text": "But the question of fate is a fake question. It’s a refusal to see how the good daughter is a part of the problem. As a kid, I was the exception, the one who would “make it out of the ghetto,” the one bused out of town for school. I liked being the exception. I loved the ways people’s eyes would glimmer when I told them any little thing about my life, or when I simply said anything aloud. “So well spoken,” the middle-class blacks would say. I basked, annoyingly, in their glow. I didn’t mind either when my brother failed, because his failure meant my light shone even brighter."

        "text": "When Bruce is seventeen, already dropped out of high school, and I am eleven, I’m allowed to go on ski vacations with the white families whose children I go to school with. I can’t ski, but they are patient. I don’t notice that I’m the only black face on the Vermont slopes. On the first trip, I’ve brought with me my beloved copy of Thoreau’s Walden; or, Life in the Woods, not that I could understand much of it. I loved it anyway for its mysteriousness, and for how its I stands so solidly in the wilderness."

        "text": "When I return home, I look up each word that confuses in the hardcover Webster’s Dictionary. I discover whole worlds of rebelliousness in Thoreau’s words, fascinated by the prospect of being “born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf.” I was drawn to orphan stories of all sorts, especially ones about wolves raising children. To stoke that fantasy, I also read the novel Julie of the Wolves, about an orphan Inuit girl, several times. After being sexually assaulted by Daniel, whom she stupidly marries even though he clearly has some kind of severe mental disability, Julie runs off to live in the Alaskan tundra with a wolf pack. I had some idea from Walden and Julie of the Wolves of a totalizing and enduring freedom of the wild—one that can only be obtained outside human society, particularly human family structures. By middle school, I already had this idea of myself as a person akin to Thoreau’s first person, who would thrive by dropping out of the known social world."

        "text": "Though literature is thick with this kind of adventure of the individual, the protagonists of these narratives are rarely, if ever, black. Toni Morrison’s Baby Suggs makes the point: “Not a house in the country ain’t packed to its rafters with some dead Negro’s grief.” In literature, being black is mostly about containment, or about the body as an obstacle to the wild freedom of roaming adventure. But it’s a tricky containment, because the black body is contained in “blackness,” and that blackness enables further containments. The containment of the body in its skin is the means by which we, as black people, are identifiable. This ability for us to be ID’d also facilitates our disappearance in plain sight. To disappear is opposite to the self-discovery made possible by encountering, with any measure of purity, a vast nature, no matter how badly we want it."

        "text": "The night of Bruce’s washing-machine-hose beating, the images would not leave me, and have not left me still. I sat with him upstairs in his room, watching his body swell up into big, bulbous bruises. He had not fought back. Instead, he hunkered and cried like a small boy, when in fact he was nudging up on manhood. This reduction was one result of his training by our tyrannical father. It was a private opinion made manifest in Bruce’s body, a transference of thought into matter, a tyranny all supreme. Before this night, my brother was swallowed already—a person trapped within a person. He had ambitions that were entirely unrealistic: architect, golf course designer, business owner. He had begun to accumulate masses of random objects until his bedroom was so cluttered with things collected from yard sales and traded from friends that he was forced to sleep on a twin mattress on the floor. Though there were others less severe, this beating in particular seemed to cement him inside a very small world he’d likely never leave. One would think that the smaller your world, the safer you are."
