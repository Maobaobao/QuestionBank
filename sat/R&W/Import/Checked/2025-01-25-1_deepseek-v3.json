      "text": "WHEN I WORKED as a data scientist at LinkedIn in 2018 and 2019, AI was of interest only to a small team of people in the data science organization with advanced degrees in statistics or computer science. AI—and especially its newest star, generative AI—is now a central theme in corporate boardrooms, leadership discussions, and casual exchanges among employees eager to supercharge their productivity. The topic is so fundamental that “Data Science for Managers,” a course I helped create to teach MBA students how to develop, leverage, and manage AI, is now a first-year requirement at Harvard Business School."

      "text": "Sadly, beneath the aspirational headlines and the tantalizing potential lies a sobering reality: Most AI projects fail. Some estimates place the failure rate as high as 80%—almost double the rate of corporate IT project failures a decade ago. There are ways, however, to increase the odds of success. Through my experience in industry and academia and my consulting work, I have found that companies can greatly reduce their risk of failure by carefully navigating five critical steps that every AI project traverses on its way to becoming a product: selection, development, evaluation, adoption, and management. This article isn’t just about preventing failure, however. It’s also about developing what I call “data science and AI operations” processes that can help companies compete and survive in an increasingly AI-driven business landscape."

      "text": "Although effectively prioritizing and sequencing projects is a task most leaders are familiar with, AI projects have a few idiosyncrasies that require careful consideration when assessing their impact and feasibility. Begin by considering internal- and external-facing projects separately. Internal-facing projects are designed to help a company’s employees perform their jobs. For example, organizations now regularly rely on AI to provide their sales teams with insights on which customers to target and what products to offer; to enhance their supply chain management through predictive analytics; and to streamline HR functions using smart chatbots for employee queries, among many other things. External-facing projects develop and implement AI for end users who are the company’s customers. They are the most visible applications of AI and were pioneered by technology companies; examples include Netflix’s recommendation engine, Google’s search results, and Uber’s matching algorithm."
