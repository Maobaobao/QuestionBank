        "text": "People who live in communities that strongly oppose abortion are more likely to suffer negative mental health effects from it, even though they personally feel confident they made the right decision for them, per the Turnaway Study. And the more stigma a patient felt when they got their abortion, the more psychological distress they had as a result five years out. “This speaks to the negative power of shame surrounding abortion,” says Dr. Shah. “We need to normalize abortion as a common part of people’s reproductive lifespan, like miscarriage, infertility, and adoption.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Unfortunately, stigma can come from even well-meaning people and self-described supporters of abortion, too (say, a friend who says, “I’m prochoice but I’d never get an abortion”). Stigma exists in the medical community, too, especially against people who have had multiple abortions or are nearing the end of their reproductive years, adds Dr. Shah. “I had a patient, who was forty-one, come to me crying, telling me another doctor had told her she should continue the pregnancy because this could be her last chance. Not once did her doctor ask her how she felt about it,” says Dr. Shah."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "For a lot of patients, their doctor is the only person they feel they can talk to about their abortion, so that conversation can have a deep and lasting impact on the patient’s perception of it, says Dr. Shah. “I tell people it’s really common and that they’re not alone and their shoulders always drop in relief. I used to be afraid to tell people I was an abortion provider, but once I started slowly coming out about it, I was met with a lot of compassion. Sometimes we hide because we think we’re the only ones, but the reality is that everyone has an experience with abortion.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "Not everyone has an abortion in a clinic; some choose to have a medication abortion (available to people who are up to ten weeks pregnant) at home. Medication abortion involves taking the pills mifepristone (to stop a pregnancy from growing) and then misoprostol (to cause cramping that empties the uterus)."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "In the past, you had to get these pills from your doctor in an office. But since April 2021, when the Biden administration temporarily lifted the FDA requirement that the first of the two abortion pills must be administered in a doctor’s office, in certain states, there’s no longer a need to visit a doctor (or even a pharmacy) to get these pills."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Enter Abortion-on-Demand (AOD), the first large-scale teleabortion provider in the United States, which can help people get abortion pills in the mail. When patients visit abortionondemand.org, they can fill out a questionnaire, have a video consult with a doctor, then have pills shipped to them overnight. This means safe, at-home medication abortions will be much more accessible—a total gamechanger for people who live far from a provider or may have difficulty securing time off from work, travel, and childcare to get to a facility. These pills are also cheaper—the service is $239, about $300 less than a typical medication abortion involving a clinic visit. More good news? Sixty percent of all profits from the service will go to the Abortion Care Network (ACN), an organization that supports independent, in-person clinics. While teleabortion access means fewer people will need to visit clinics, the AOD founder, Jamie Phifer, MD, didn’t want the service to lead to the shutdown of clinics that people who need later abortions depend on."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "Currently, AOD is available in twenty states, with plans to expand to seven more states soon. “Making medication abortion easier to access is critical to advancing health equity and ensuring all people can access time-sensitive abortion care,” says Johnson. While this access is still a temporary measure, Johnson hopes the FDA will conduct a review of the full set of restrictions on mifepristone “to ensure all patients can access medication abortion without an in-person visit—during the pandemic and beyond.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "For those who don’t live in a state with AOD and who can’t have an in-clinic abortion because it’s inaccessible for distance and/or monetary reasons—or because having an abortion openly could put them in danger of abusive people around them—there are still options available. In these cases, some people perform what’s known as a self-managed abortion."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "Basically, self-managed abortions work the same as having a medication abortion at home, but you’re acquiring the pills without a prescription or consultation with a doctor before taking them. While this method can be safe when patients are armed with proper information, says Dr. Gabriela Aguilar, MD, an ob-gyn and fellow and clinical instructor of family planning at Yale School of Medicine, there are potential health risks (you don’t have a doctor you can turn to for guidance if something goes wrong) as well as legal ramifications to self-managed abortions."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "You can learn about self-managed abortion options at aidaccess.org, as well as plancpills.org, which outlines how people facilitate safe, self-managed abortions in different locations where laws vary, says Dr. Aguilar. You can also take advantage of a chatbot called Ally on WhatsApp (833-221-ALLY) to answer your medical abortion questions in real time. It was launched in April by Women First Digital (WFD), a collection of online platforms that provides information and counseling services on safe abortion, contraception, and sexual and reproductive health, with the goal of being the world’s first abortion virtual assistant."
