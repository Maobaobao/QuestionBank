      "text": "Any effective strategic effort begins by having the CEO set the tone and direction, but the central player in sustainability initiatives is logically the person who leads the sustainability function. That executive may have a title like VP of sustainability, chief sustainability officer (CSO), or head of ESG (which addresses environmental, social, and governance issues). Leadership from the top isn’t enough, however. A focus on sustainability needs to be embedded throughout the organization. People in procurement, HR, R&D, finance, marketing, sales, customer service, and more have to do their part too."

      "text": "In fact, we believe that the success or failure of sustainability initiatives often depends on a cohort of hidden actors and unsung heroes: an organization’s midlevel executives and team leaders. These people fill a broad range of roles, from key positions just below the C-suite to factory or store manager. They’re internal warriors who feel the intense squeeze of needing to hit sustainability and financial targets. They may not have “sustainability” in their job titles, but many will see it as a core responsibility, capability, and career builder."

      "text": "How do middle managers help drive sustainability efforts? The answer varies with a company’s aspirations and experience—in other words, with its sustainability maturity. Based on the patterns we’ve seen across hundreds of companies, we’ve identified four main levels of maturity: (1) lagging and skeptical, (2) building a base, (3) accelerating, and (4) leading. Companies don’t fall neatly into one category, of course. A lower-maturity company may have a bright spot of sustainability innovation. And even recognized leaders— like Unilever (where one of us, Paul, was a long-serving CEO), Patagonia, and IKEA—lag in some areas."

      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "The overarching role of midlevel leaders is to help prepare their organizations for larger initiatives. As Marks & Spencer’s former CSO Mike Barry told us, “You want to embed the next plan into the current plan” so that you’re ready for the next stage of the journey. To go deeper and build sustainability into the organization, middle managers at all maturity levels need to know how to network and collaborate across the organizational matrix (with, say, both functions and brands). They also must be able to work within the firm’s culture while adjusting it to include a bias toward greater action; to make the business case, which will get more sophisticated at higher levels; and to look outside the company for inspiration and partnerships. In addition, no matter what type of organization they work for or where they sit in it, these advocates for change need to be courageous, collaborative, entrepreneurial, optimistic, and open to alternative viewpoints."
