    {
      "passage_number": 1,
      "text": "Woof isn’t the only well-being platform making inroads in Danish schools. Platforms like Bloomsights, Moods, and Klassetrivsel (Danish for 'classroom well-being') are also getting traction. Each takes a more data-intensive and less anonymous approach than Woof, tracking and identifying schoolchildren individually. Bloomsights and Klassetrivsel even go as far as generating 'sociograms'—network diagrams that display the children’s relationships with each other in detail."
    },
    {
      "passage_number": 2,
      "text": "Bloomsights turns self-reported data from the same individuals over time into indicators including 'signs of loneliness,' 'academic mindset,' and 'signs of bullying.' Bloomsights is also used in the US, where some school districts are including it as part of an 'early warning system' for identifying potential school shooters. The company’s US operations are based in Colorado. Cofounder Adam Rockenbach says the hope in bringing Bloomsights to the US was to spread the Scandinavian values of well-being and community. He asserts that the app is not meant to be a dystopian 'Big Brother' but an extension of what teachers already do."

    {
      "passage_number": 3,
      "text": "Citing his experiences as a teacher in inner-city schools in Los Angeles for six years, Rockenbach says it can be a challenge to know what is really going on with children who struggle in an environment that might be marked by gang violence and poverty. He says Bloomsights can help in situations where the signals are not so clear. Rockenbach believes that anonymous data only makes early intervention more difficult, since it creates more work for teachers and educators in trying to identify who has problems and needs help. For this reason, he thinks collecting individual data is a necessity."

      "passage_number": 4,
      "text": "The program, which operates through a web app, takes self-reporting measurements similar to Woof’s: monthly surveys of students, measuring various indicators of mental and physical well-being and students’ evaluation of their learning environment."
