        "text": "Cutting emissions in the near term will require shifting away from polluting fossil fuels for energy production and toward renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The scale of wind and solar deployment already underway is staggering: the world is set to build as much wind and solar capacity in the five years between 2022 and 2027 as it did in the past two decades, according to the International Energy Agency.<br>Plummeting costs have helped this growth: between 2010 and 2019, the cost of solar energy fell by about 85%, the report says. Wind energy costs dropped by about half during the same time frame. Now, wind and solar are among the cheapest energy sources available—deploying new solar and wind farms can be even cheaper than just maintaining existing coal power plants in the US. But as inexpensive as wind and solar are, they can still represent a significant financial investment. That’s why the new report emphasizes that improved access to financing, especially for developing nations, would help speed climate action."

        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Cutting methane emissions this decade will be key to reaching climate goals and limiting peak warming levels: hitting the 1.5 °C target will require methane emissions to fall by a third between 2019 and 2030, according to the IPCC report. Some of the top targets for emissions cuts include oil and gas production and food waste.<br>Investments in new infrastructure to cut methane emissions from oil and gas could end up breaking even: according to the IEA, an annual investment of $11 billion would be needed to clean up the sector, but the value of the captured methane could be more than enough to cover the cost."

        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "The impacts of human-caused climate change 'threaten our life support system, nature itself,' said Lee. Conserving and restoring natural ecosystems will not only be key for preserving biodiversity—it’ll have emissions benefits too. Natural ecosystems can trap and store carbon, and tropical rain forests are among the planet’s largest carbon sinks. Preserving these and other ecosystems could be a low-cost, high-value way to slow climate change.<br>Policies around the world are already helping to cut deforestation, according to the IPCC report. And in December 2022, over 190 nations signed a UN biodiversity pledge to protect 30% of the natural world by 2030."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "Shifting to public transportation and biking for some travel needs is an inexpensive way to limit near-term emissions. And boosting efficiency in everything from vehicles to appliances could shave off emissions too. Public policies have already been effective at boosting efficiency measures in particular, according to the report. Efficiency gains can also help make climate progress in sectors like aviation and shipping, which will be much more difficult to clean up in the long term. Many of these solutions are the same ones that the IPCC and others have been talking about for decades.<br>Now, there’s only one clear path forward. 'We must move from climate procrastination to climate action,' Andersen said, 'and we must begin this today.'"
