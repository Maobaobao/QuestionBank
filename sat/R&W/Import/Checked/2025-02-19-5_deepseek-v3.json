        "text": "While America roils in plagues of politics, viruses, and a persistent reckoning with its racist past and present, few have paid attention to the perceived progressive bastion of environmentalism. If the Muir revelation might be likened to one of the giant redwoods he worshipped, rife with heart rot, falling hard in a forest where we can all see and hear it, then John James Audubon’s racism is the albatross rotting around the necks of those who would hold him in reverence. It is past smelling foul and beginning to reek."

        "text": "Audubon enslaved people. He bought and sold humans like horses. That is evidence enough to recast the hero into a different role. The organizations bearing Audubon’s name must press forward in this new light and decide who and what they want to be. Most of their members are white people with enough disposable income to dump into the coffers of overwhelmingly white-led organizations who have no need or desire for John James to be anyone other than the myth. No one willingly pays memberships for discomfort, but if “progress” is the end goal, then it’s a likely partner."

        "text": "Why muddy the ornithological water with race? Because racism pervades everything—even our love of birds. To see it blatantly codified in black and white is sad proof of a deeply ingrained bias. South Carolina Audubon Society reports from the early 1900s blame Black people for the decline in songbirds and waterfowl. Arthur T. Wayne, a luminary among South Carolina ornithologists, placed “negroes” among a litany of agents (alongside raccoons and house cats) deleterious to bobwhite quail in the book Birds of South Carolina. Racism even found its way into later ornithological texts. Sprunt and Chamberlain’s seminal book, South Carolina Birdlife, published in 1949, cites the colloquial name of double-crested cormorants as “niggergeese”—a name for a bird perceived as deceptive and useless that’s still being thrown around in duck blinds today. Perspective matters, and there is every reason to be concerned if institutions insist on not changing for the sake of tradition or donors easily offended."

        "text": "Audubon may have passed as white, but most importantly, he passed on the chance to be a better human being. That is weight that should bear heaviest on all the preconceived notions, and I for one will have to tear down any monuments I’ve erected to him. Race and racism are immutable facts of my life. I am proudly a Black man. I am consistently punished for that identity, even among birders. I hold all these thoughts as I hold on to my Audubon books and prints. I won’t burn them, but I’ll see the Carolina parakeets and every other bird or animal he painted in a different kind of slanting light."

        "text": "A few years ago I had a close encounter with an elephant folio myself. On a quick turnaround trip to Manhattan, my friend Jason Saul rushed me to the New-York Historical Society to lay eyes on a rare copy of Audubon’s masterpiece. With time growing short, we got there only to find the gallery closed. I strained over the velvet ropes, trying my best to see the ornithological Holy Grail. No luck. As Jason cursed, then implored one staffer after another to let us in for “just a glance,” I caught sight of an exhibit at the other end of the hall: Black Citizenship in the Age of Jim Crow. It was the worst kind of bird exhibit, but I was drawn in."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "I wandered through a maze of misery, overcome. Blackness defined and then institutionally defiled. It was an American blind spot wrought over almost a century. I lost sight of the off-limits Audubon and immersed myself in the hard and heroic history of my people. As I neared the exhibit’s end, Jason found me. He’d somehow gained entrance to the gallery. With my mind still lingering in the story of segregation, we entered—and there it was, looming even larger than I could’ve imagined. Beneath the glass, the folio’s pages were opened to Baltimore orioles—two brilliant orange-and-black males and an equally beautiful, muted brown-and-ochre female perched on a pendulous nest."

        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "Audubon’s art lives like none other. That is fact. But that day, the facts of Jim Crow trumped his talent, a genius consumed by a system of bias he bought into. I later posted a photo of me staring at the black birds under glass, just down the hall from an exhibit on Black folks trapped under a ceiling that never let them see upwards. One was a history of which I had become a part, the other a history of which my ancestors had been a part. I made my train to Philly and thought about the irony all the way south."

        "text": "It’s been a long haul from my early childhood flight-and-feather obsession to this complex thinking about just how the lives of birds can be “saved” even as we try to save ourselves from one another. Black lives matter now. They always have. Always will. It’s critical to not just say the words or change some bird’s colonialist name but also to change old mission to new, by persistent, sustainable acts to make the words live in policy and practice."

        "text": "These days I sit in my side-yard writing shack, writing less than I should, Zooming more than I want, and thinking way too much. I’m spending hours pondering who I am in the context of who we are as a community of bird adorers, nature nurturers, and Americans divided into extreme factions. It’s no easy feat watching birds without some echo of societal racism interrupting the songs of Carolina wrens. In one moment, I hope that evening grosbeaks will magically show up at my feeders in this finch irruption year; in the next, I think about the eruption of hate. I know it won’t be magic that makes things better in America, but hard work and the people and organizations who say they care showing it."

        "text": "I know that’s possible. In the wake of racist encounters, I’ve been buoyed by an overwhelmingly positive and inclusive cadre of kindred spirits—good people who treat me with respect and love, people who want better for humans and birds. And, yes, there are organizations trying to do better. In this current call for awareness, they are digging deep and deserving of affirmation and support. But then, painful as it may be, we need to call truth to power—past and present—where it is stuck or regressive.<br><br>I look over my shoulder as I work on this essay, and there, on the shelf, is John James Audubon, memorialized on a book’s dust jacket. His eagle eyes are fixed, it seems, on me. His vision of “my kind” is clear. And now, I see him more clearly, too. He was a despicable racist birder of his time, and now of this time. I’m hoping such an identification isn’t one I have to make often. But I know many blind spots remain in the wake of a legacy that can either be ignored to a fate of stagnancy and decline or be learned from to move, with eyes wider open, toward a more equitable, just, and inclusive conservation future. I have a small, framed picture of George Washington Carver, the nature-loving Black man who saved the South’s soil and was rumored to have loved birds as I do. I desire a better view and believe I’ve found just the spot for the Tuskegee professor, between me and John James. There. Blind spot gone."
