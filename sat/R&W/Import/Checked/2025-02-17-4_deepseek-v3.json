        "text": "Natasha Batalha, Natalie Batalha’s second child, was eighteen when she went to Florida for the Kepler launch. She remembers tagging along with her younger sister in the viewing room where the NASA science team had gathered. 'During the launch, the anxiety that was in that space was chilling,' she said on a recent video call. After liftoff, the scene turned jubilant. She found it inspiring to see a team accomplish something so grand, but it was the possibility of discoveries being so close at hand 'that was really what flipped on my brain to start thinking about exoplanets as a concept,' said Natasha Batalha, who is serious and precise, like her mother."

        "text": "Space wasn’t a constant topic of discussion in the Batalha household. 'I didn’t want to saturate their lives with science,' Natalie Batalha said. 'I always wanted them to feel like they were number one.' But she and Celso did have 'a secret hope' about Natasha. One evening in 1996 while Celso was teaching a night class, Natalie loaded up the half-asleep kids to drive them to a meadow so they look for the passing comet Hyakutake. Before they’d pulled out of the driveway, five-year-old Natasha said from the back seat: 'What’s that?' She was pointing at the comet."

        "text": "When Natasha was eight and living in Brazil, her mother asked her and her siblings to draw an astronomer. Natasha drew a white man, and Natalie asked her why. 'This was crazy for me, the daughter of a Latinx scientist and a female scientist; I still had these stereotypes ingrained in my mind,' Natasha said. She suddenly felt empowered by the thought that she could belong in science."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "A couple of years later she read Sally Ride’s autobiography. Just as her mother had been inspired by Ride, Natasha decided to become either an astronomer or an astronaut. She dreamed of being the first person on Mars. After the Kepler launch, as more and more exoplanets were discovered, she grew interested in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how we might infer its presence on those planets through telescope observations of their skies. She got a dual Ph.D. in astronomy and astrobiology. Then, soon after Kepler ended and her mom left NASA Ames to become a professor at Santa Cruz, Natasha took a job at Ames studying exoplanet atmospheres."

        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "Natasha Batalha is part of a growing research community whose ultimate goal is to detect 'biosignature gases'—gases in a planet’s atmosphere that could only be there because of life. Every kind of molecule has characteristic wavelengths that it absorbs. So by collecting light from a star when a planet is and isn’t transiting in front of it, and checking which wavelengths of starlight grow dimmer when the planet is there, you can see which molecules are present in the planet’s sky."

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Oxygen is an obvious candidate for a biosignature gas: It’s so reactive that it’s unlikely to be found unless the planet’s oxygen supply is continually replenished by, say, a biosphere doing photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is such a simple and efficient energy-capturing procedure that astrobiologists think it’s likely to evolve on any living planet, so oxygen is smart to look for."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "But seeing oxygen by itself wouldn’t necessarily be convincing. Computer simulations show that under some conditions, oxygen can fill the skies of lifeless planets. 'The challenge is there’s not one gas that’s going to be a biosignature gas,' said Hammel, the planetary scientist. 'Methane on Earth is mostly produced by cows … but you look at Neptune, and you can see tons of methane there, and that’s not produced by cows.'"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "A better biosignature is a peculiar mix of gases. 'It’s not going to be a single gas, it’s going to have to be a combination of gases in a configuration that tells us they are in a disequilibrium state,' said Hammel. 'They can’t have formed that way naturally.'"

        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "Existing telescopes have already spotted molecular fingerprints in the skies of hot Jupiters, but these are lifeless planets. Detecting the weaker signals from rocky, possibly habitable planets’ skies will require JWST. Not only will the telescope have close to one hundred times Hubble’s resolution, but it will see exoplanets far more clearly against the background of their host stars since planets emit more infrared than optical light while stars emit less. Importantly, Webb’s view of exoplanets won’t be obscured by clouds, which often prevent optical telescopes from seeing the densest, low-altitude layers of atmosphere. 'Imagine being in a plane and looking down at an insane cloud deck, and you can’t see the surface at all,' Natasha Batalha said. 'When you look at infrared light, you can all of a sudden see through the cloud deck.'"

        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "Exoplanets will be among the targets in JWST’s 'Cycle 1' round of observations, which it will start tackling as soon as deployment and commissioning are complete—about six months after launch. The exoplanet community elected Natalie Batalha to lead transit spectroscopy studies of three gas giants as part of these early observations. Her team will also develop data pipelines and processing techniques for the community to copy."
