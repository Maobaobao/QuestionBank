        "text": "I spent that first afternoon alone, without my family, on the terrace of the Café Ti-Loup, in a pleasant state of half-reading, half-listening to a couple arguing, to a father and his adolescent son sharing a moment of taut silence, glad for once not to be contributing to the ambient family discord but bearing peaceable witness to it instead. I was getting ready to leave my table when I saw her, walking on the other side of the street, and into the caisse populaire. The similarity was so uncanny that it wouldn’t be right to merely call it a resemblance. No, in that instant, there was no doubt in my mind that it was her, my mother, as she had been the year of her death, nearly twelve years before—tall, fair, the same proud, inquisitive nose, the dark, expressive parentheses for eyebrows. I drank three large gulps of water, standing there above the flimsy outdoor table, trying to steady my hands, which were now cold and shaking, the nails drained of their pink. My mind immediately set to breaking the spell: the hair was different and I didn’t remember my mother being quite so tall. And yet I could not convince myself that it was not her. The waitress asked me if I needed anything, she was hoping to give the table to someone else, and I managed to say absentmindedly: Non, tout va bien, mademoiselle, allez-y, and step out onto the sidewalk, where I stood, agitated, like a dog tied to a lamppost, waiting for its owner to return from an errand."

        "text": "Moments later, my mother emerged from the bank again, her head down, as she placed a large wallet, with its old-fashioned ball clasp, the very kind I suddenly remembered she’d always carried, back into her handbag. As she lifted her head my error was revealed: the nose was all wrong—flatter, broader—the eyebrows thicker and far darker than I’d first thought. The entire effect was unpleasant, and I was reminded of the time when in a restaurant some years earlier on Saint-Denis, out for dinner with my husband, Bertrand, I had ordered a cheese soufflé and found, past the miraculous and airy dome, the slimy amniotic soup of raw egg beneath."

        "text": "That queasy feeling, a tightness at my jaw, remained all day. By the evening, even the apartment had begun to bear the signs of my nausea, of this close call with another realm. I opened the door to my daughter’s room and turned the lights on and off and back on again. What did I hope to find there? My mother, smiling, her teeth in their gentle disarray, her heavy breasts, her unyielding blue eyes? In reality, I found nothing but the indelible traces of my daughter—opposite to my mother’s old-world austerity—the bright colors of the feather boa that she had worn at Halloween slung over the headboard. Dafna was a girl of accessories, talismans, shells collected and arranged, collages she’d made tacked to the corkboard, memories of herself."

        "text": "I had collected nothing as a child, not a rock or a doll.<br><br>We had spent the days before Dafna’s departure for summer camp shopping and packing, finding the perfect sleeping bag and flip-flops, the myriad toiletries that pleased her. Under regular circumstances, I would have let Bertrand take care of this part of the preparations, but I must have felt a certain amount of guilt about the plan from which I had excluded myself entirely. He would drive her to the camp just north of Quebec City; he would pick her up. And in the interim, he would take the opportunity to visit with his mother, who had been recently widowed and was desperate for the company of her favorite child. There had been some talk, when the plan had first been devised, of my going with them, staying with Bertrand in his mother’s house, but the accommodation was uncomfortable, a lone cot that we would have to share like much younger versions of ourselves. In those first years together, I had welcomed the discomfort of this sleeping arrangement and its forced physical closeness verging on siblinghood, which, having grown up as an only child, I found nearly erotic. Or perhaps, to put it simply, I had been hungry, in those early years, for any excuse to be physically close to Bertrand. His nearness, from the beginning, had seemed like a kind of concession granted to me by some stroke of luck or circumstance."

        "text": "His mother, it was no great secret, had never especially liked me. She had couched the feeling as linguistic in nature, cultural in kind. My French, at age twenty, had been so halting and internal, I could not blame her for finding me an odd and abrupt successor to Bertrand’s most recent girlfriend, a francophone classmate in his PhD program, whom he had been with for the better part of a decade. But it was my refusal, a few years later, to christen our daughter, which I justified would have ostracized me permanently from my own Jewish family, that had been my first unpardonable sin. My open insistence on speaking English to Dafna, even when we visited Quebec City, had surely not helped my cause either. But even after it had been clear that my efforts had failed—Dafna had not spoken a word to me in English since she had started public school in French two years earlier, and there were increasingly vociferous stirrings about wanting to be confirmed—Bertrand’s mother’s disapproval had broadened, like a kind of generosity, to include the farthest reaches of my decision-making: my choice to work only part-time as a homework assistant in an English boys’ school, my preference not to dye my hair, even after it turned, shortly after Dafna’s birth, prematurely salt and pepper.<br><br>I would not have said, at the time, that summer of 1992, that my family was falling apart, only that we were at something like an impasse, that it was true that my eight-year-old daughter’s sizable will had recently flourished and seemed aimed at annihilating me. My husband, despite his efforts at fairness, firmly sided with our daughter, and so a fault line had emerged, and I had found it easy to simply give myself over to it, to fall into this trench in my own family life. And yet the problem was that I could not remember a time before this one, the arrangement before this one. I could not recall ever having been pleasantly and easily at the center of my own life, at the center of Bertrand’s attentions. Like all small familial tragedies, it seemed, that year, as though it had been there all along, this truth, waiting to live out its inevitability. For months now, I had wanted this time alone, advocated for it. In our ten years together, I had asked for almost nothing from Bertrand. This is not to say that I had been a particularly good wife, only that my badness, if you could call it that, had little to do with making actual demands."
