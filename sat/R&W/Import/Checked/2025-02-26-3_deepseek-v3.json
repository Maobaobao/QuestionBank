        "text": "One of staunchest political advocates of paid leave is New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who in February 2021 introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY)—a program that would provide up to twelve weeks of national paid family leave, covering childbirth, family illness, and more, for—in her words—'about the cost of a cup of coffee a week.' This is, depressingly, the fourth time it’s been introduced (it failed in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019), but Gillibrand—who has never given up—and the lobbying organization Paid Leave for All speak in hushed but hopeful whispers of a growing momentum across the political divide to get something done."

        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Gillibrand names senators Susan Collins, Deb Fischer, Joni Ernst, Mitt Romney, and Bill Cassidy as the Republicans 'most interested in paid leave.' But she notes that the road to success is long, because as yet, there is no agreement on a financial model to get it through. 'Senator Manchin has said he only wants to do [paid leave] on a bipartisan basis,' Gillibrand explains. 'But the truth is there are no Republicans who want to support the FAMILY Act as written, and so by saying it has to be bipartisan, he’s killing it.'"

        "text": "In the meantime, she is exasperated at the impact of the country’s lack of paid leave on the economy: 'Every time a family member needs to stop working because they’ve had a new baby or an ill parent or a sick child—for many people they either have to quit their job and meet that need. Or they have to suffer through not meeting that need and continue to work because they have to put food on the table. That’s a choice people shouldn’t have to make. It’s devastating for many families and many individuals. It’s essential that families have that time together.'"

        "text": "Dawn Huckelbridge, the founding director of Paid Leave for All, is equally passionate: 'I’d studied paid leave, and I knew about it at this abstract or intellectual level. But it was when I became pregnant and gave birth that it just became so core to me. It felt like this is one of the root problems that leads to so many other inequities. I was shocked at how badly I felt treated, as a woman with a lot of privilege, with health care, with a supportive family, with a little bit of paid leave, but not enough.'"

        "text": "'My son had really bad colic, and he screamed every day, all the time. He wouldn’t sleep; he wouldn’t let me sleep. So for the better part of a year, I barely sat down. I didn’t eat. I barely slept. I nursed around the clock, just trying to keep him from blowing up. And by the end of it, I remember saying, 'I get why some mothers in this country just snap.' I was so tired. I was ready to give up, and I felt trapped. And I just kept thinking, If it’s this hard for me, how is it possible that one in four people in this country go back to work within two weeks? It blew my mind. And I felt like this was this whole world of injustice that, until I lived it, I didn’t understand how urgent it was. Now I plan to do whatever I can to achieve paid leave for everyone who works.'"

Now I plan to do whatever I can to achieve paid leave for everyone who works.'<br><br>Here’s the thing: The issue of paid leave is deeply and inextricably personal. It is personal to Dawn Huckelbridge, who as a highly successful policy advocate only truly understood its importance when she became a mother. It is personal to Meghan Markle, the duchess of Sussex, who has been an outspoken supporter of paid leave. It is personal to former supermodel Christy Turlington, founder of Every Mother Counts. It is personal to actor Freida Pinto, who recently had her first child and tells Glamour, 'I feel very fortunate that I was empowered to take as much time as I needed, both by my family and my team. I understand that is not the case for most women, which is why we need to discuss this more. It’s time to empower changes to the systems and standards in place.'"

        "text": "It’s personal to Hillary Clinton, who tells Glamour, 'When I had Chelsea I literally had to create the maternity leave policy at my law firm. Even unpaid leave was not a guaranteed right. Four decades later, we’ve made progress, but we still have much to do.' It is personal to me because after the birth of my first daughter, I was so physically impacted by a challenging vaginal delivery that it hurt to walk or sit for two months. Whatever my complicated emotional feelings were about becoming a mother, physically I needed every single day of the six months I took off—three months fully paid, three months at half pay. (I had both my children in the UK, and had I taken off longer with my first, I would have transitioned to the country’s standard weekly maternity pay.)"

        "text": "It’s personal to Gillibrand, whose own two births and postpartum experiences, no matter that they were nineteen and fourteen years ago, were full of such deep challenges that it shapes her policy today. 'I had preeclampsia. I had gestational diabetes. I was really sick after I delivered Theo [her eldest] with an emergency C-section, and I was in the hospital for a whole week. My body shut down. If I didn’t have a husband—which a lot of women don’t have, and are birthing children on their own—the baby wouldn’t have eaten. We had to do formula feeding that first week. And my law firm didn’t have a paid-leave program. So I was like, 'I’m going to write you one, because this is a liability for you.' And I was able to take three months’ paid leave, and it worked for me, and it got me on my feet again. It got me time to learn how to nurse. It got me time to learn how to be a mom.'"

        "text": "And it’s personal to many millions of families and working women and men in this country who have likely been through the complex swirl of joy and confusion and exhaustion and financial stress that new parenthood brings with it. But it raises the question: When something can mean so much and can impact women’s lives so detrimentally and has been an issue for successive governments, why for over one hundred years has it been so impossible to pass into law? Huckelbridge and Gillibrand don’t hold back: Sexism."

        "text": "Huckelbridge says, 'We are not a partisan organization. But what we’ve seen in Washington recently, which is disheartening, is it’s become about which side is getting a win. The opposition [to paid leave] has been pretty irrational, and it is bearing out as clear sexism. It is bearing out as total devaluing of women’s work and women’s lives.' When asked if the reason we can’t get paid leave into law is that there are so many men in Congress, Gillibrand answers without hesitation: 'Yes. There’s not enough caregivers in Congress, which tend to be women. We only have 25 percent women in Congress.'"
