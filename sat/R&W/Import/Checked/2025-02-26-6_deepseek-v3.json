        "text": "Caserta and I talk at some length about his journey to become the man who would be arrested on October 7, 2020. After what he describes as 'a pretty normal childhood'—skateboarding, shooting his BB gun, learning guitar, fantasizing about being a rock star, mountain biking—in his midtwenties he found himself feeling adrift. His life wasn’t going the way that he wanted it to go. 'I felt like kind of like Morpheus says in The Matrix, it was ‘like a splinter in your mind.’ It’s bugging you. You know there’s something wrong with the world and you know something’s going on, but you don’t know what it is. And that’s kind of what I felt. So I started reading a lot more books about philosophy and freedom.'"

        "text": "When Caserta reels off a list of the people whom he subsequently discovered and found useful or influential—David Icke, Alex Jones, Lloyd Pye, Jordan Peterson, Mark Passio, G. Edward Griffin, Ron Paul, Larken Rose, and Lysander Spooner—I flinch more than once. Even so, when Caserta explains what he took from them, it’s hard to see how it differs from a standard liberal we’d-like-the-young-to-think-for-themselves screed. 'Things weren’t going my way, and I realized, You know what?' he says. 'The problem isn’t the world. The problem isn’t outside. The problem is me. The reason why I’m not getting what I want and what I desire is because of me. So I need to change myself, and then the external world will change for me. If I enact good behaviors into the world, the consequences that I’ll receive will be better, especially if I work hard at it. So I developed that mentality to where the taking on of personal responsibility will generate happiness. I kind of learned that from Jordan Peterson. And I said, You know what? I’m going to try this. And it worked.'"

        "text": "Guns became important to him after the March 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand. To him, the New Zealand government’s subsequent moves to restrict gun ownership made no sense. 'I thought to myself, We have a lot of those mass shootings in America, and there’s a lot of people that are in fear,' he says. 'So the best thing I can do for myself and for people I care about is to actually get a firearm and really, really learn how to use it in case something like that happened.' He bought a Smith & Wesson SD40 VE, then a Bushmaster XM15-E2S, then a Glock 29. The Glock 29 is what he’s carrying right now—he has a concealed-pistol license. He notes that he’s never shot, or even drawn, a gun in anger."

        "text": "He had also begun to identify as an anarchist, again inspired by his latest reading, specifically Larken Rose’s The Most Dangerous Superstition and Lysander Spooner’s No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority. 'When they were explaining the concepts of authority, that is something that really helped me wake up,' he says. 'I realized that the state is an institution of violence and that everything that it does is predicated on the initiation of force. And that’s in violation of the anarchist principle, which is the nonaggression principle. And that’s a huge problem that we have going on today is that everyone thinks that anarchy means chaos and mayhem. So when you say you’re identifying as anarchist, they think that you want people to die.'"

        "text": "In 2020, as the COVID weeks turned into months, Caserta decided he wanted to find people to train with. 'Prior to that, I’ve been training on my own, like in my apartment and stuff.' He started researching militias and was soon invited to Wolverine Watchmen training events, though as far as he’s concerned he was never a formal member. 'The way I would explain to someone is just like: a group of guys getting together and going out in the woods and shooting guns and just having fun. And that’s how it was the whole time. It was never like this secretive, in-depth, conspiratorial, like, ‘Let’s figure out how we can attack the government.’ It was never like that. They took random conversations out of context, applied their own context to it, and then tried to leave the context out of court and make it to where the defense couldn’t actually put the context into the statements so that the government’s narrative would hold water, essentially. But yeah, it was always like just a friendly camaraderie type of environment where people just had fun and being American and shooting guns in the woods, man.'"

'Spending money on storage-able food, water, filtration, ammunition, knives, saws, fire-starting kits, stuff like that. I already had everything pretty much ready in case something bad happened.' One bit of common ground among people he would meet in this world was a sense that you have to prepare for WTSHTF. When the shit hits the fan. Many of the statements that, in court, were taken as references to 'when we kidnap the governor' were, says Caserta, references to this more general sense of a coming upheaval. 'They think we’re this apocalyptic white-supremacist group of just gun-toting violent extremists that just absolutely hate the government and they want war to happen,' he says. 'I’ve never met anyone that legitimately wanted war to happen.' The way Caserta paints it, what they’re readying for is what other people might do. 'Pretty much everyone thought, Okay, well, if shit hits the fan, we’re going to defend ourselves.'"

'I mean, honestly, man, that was one of the best summers I had. I was doing so good. I was getting raises and excelling at my job even more. I mean, I got my car fixed to where I didn’t even have to worry about anything anymore about it. I just signed a new lease on my apartment. I was still hungry for knowledge, still hungry for life. I had multiple dates set up with a couple of different girls, getting back into the dating world again after taking a break for, like, six months. Things were great, man.… I mean, I had a blast, and I got to shoot guns and use my gear. And I learned so much skills. Life was going so good.'"
