        "text": "The firefly pioneers of the twentieth century were Elisabeth and John Buck, a married couple who began methodically studying fireflies and theorizing about synchronicity in the 1930s. As a doctoral student, John outfitted a darkroom to simulate a natural cycle of day and night, filled it with fireflies, and set up a sleeping bag so that he could observe their behavior over twenty-four-hour periods. Later, the couple’s projects would take them to Jamaica, Borneo, Thailand, and Papua New Guinea. Over their long and celebrated career, the pair studied various types of bioluminescence, including those found in marine organisms, but they always returned to the puzzles of fireflies and synchronicity. “Just what capability communal synchrony demands is a question that does not come easily to us as human beings,” the Bucks wrote in 1976, “because we accept our own ability to dance or to march in unison as being second nature.”"

        "passage_number": 2,
        "text": "Indeed, although Western travelers had been documenting sightings of synchronous fireflies for centuries, researchers who preceded the Bucks were often skeptical or even hostile to the notion that invertebrates with millimeter-size brains could engage in such sophisticated behavior. They dismissed reports of firefly synchrony as accidental, as a by-product of humidity or tree sap, or as an illusion caused by a twitchy eyelid."
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 3,
        "text": "It’s now obvious that firefly synchrony not only exists but has many analogues in nature, where seemingly simple animals organize themselves in staggeringly complex ways. Spiny lobsters form single-file lines on the ocean floor and, like cyclists drafting in a pace line, move faster than any single crustacean might on its own. Vast schools of fish execute intricate high-speed maneuvers—splitting and re-forming behind a predator, for example, or bursting radially—and rarely bump into one another. Giant honeybees nesting on open combs repel predatory wasps by forming spiral waves that spread through the swarm within milliseconds. And most of us are familiar with the sight of starlings wheeling in great dark flocks across the sky, twisting and turning at thirty miles per hour, maintaining a tight choreography even as their numbers swell to the tens of thousands."

        "passage_number": 4,
        "text": "How does order arise in the absence of leaders, amid the chaos of thousands of moving, sensing, thinking beings? What, if anything, are these groups trying to achieve? Sir John Bowring, an English governor of Hong Kong, wrote in 1857 that the fireflies’ “light blazes and is extinguished by a common sympathy,” framing synchronous light displays in plainly human terms. A naturalist writing a half century later proposed that the virtuosity of starlings might be explained by avian telepathy."

        "passage_number": 5,
        "text": "Such questions might seem like natural territory for biologists, but they were first embraced by chemists and physicists. They wondered whether mathematical models that explained matter could be adapted to different systems. If biologists traditionally looked at animals as organisms within ecosystems, physicists analyzed them as particles in motion that interacted with forces, modeling the behavior of flocks and schools by using the rules that explain magnets, self-propelled particles, and maximum entropy."

        "passage_number": 6,
        "text": "Many of these quantitative researchers were inspired by the dawning science of complexity, a field embodied by the interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute, which opened in 1984. Santa Fe acolytes chased the notion of universal phenomena that share the same general mathematical descriptions. The idea was that dazzling complexity—be it a chemical reaction or termites building a mound—might arise when individuals in a system follow similar sets of rules at the local level."

      {
        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "A shortcoming of this early work was that it was almost entirely computational and theoretical. Researchers who ventured into the real world to conduct experiments struggled with the limits of what their cameras and computers could do. One famous study that involved filming starlings, by the Italian physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina, relied on an image-matching algorithm that took two years to build. Other early researchers did statistics by hand: a staggering proposition when faced with thousands of animals."

        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "“In the lab, I have what are relatively inexpensive cameras right now that are imaging at one hundred frames per second,” said Nicholas Ouellette, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford who studies midge swarms and the flocking behavior of jackdaws. “I can, you know, in a day or two, generate tens of millions of data points that I can do statistics on.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 9,
        "text": "This data revolution lets researchers test the collective behavior models from previous decades and propose new ones. In many ways, the study of animals using quantitative tools and methods is still in its infancy, wide open for discoveries that augment our understanding of evolution, animal communication, animal sensing, and possibly cognition. Many of these insights will start with fundamental questions about natural phenomena that are at once deeply familiar and stubbornly hard to explain. “What is it about a flock that makes it a flock?” Ouellette asked. “What is it about a swarm that makes it a swarm, and not just a bunch of things flying around?”"

        "text": "One evening in Congaree, I watched Sarfati’s adviser, Peleg, lift a petri dish containing a male firefly that had fallen on its back. It had switched from its normal, unhurried flashing to a more alarmed frequency, its lantern glowing quickly and urgently, a message of distress as plain as any warning beacon of human design. “In the case of fireflies, the communication is a light pattern, kind of like a flashlight that turns on and off like Morse code,” Peleg said."
