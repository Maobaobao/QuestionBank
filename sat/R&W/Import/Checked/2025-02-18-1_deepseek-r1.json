        "text": "“I unraveled it,” Loftus’s brother David, a seventy-four-year-old lawyer and the president of a Buddhist meditation center, told me in our first conversation. One night, when he was in his late thirties, he was in a hot tub and began to feel sleepy. “It was part of some drug experience, and as I was beginning to submerge, something woke me up,” he said. “I thought, wow, this is what happened to our mom. It became so clear to me that there was nothing intentional about her death.”"

        "text": "His younger brother, Robert, a property manager in Garberville, a small town near the northern tip of California, had pieced together a different explanation. In the years after their mother’s death, he was in “grief free fall,” he told me. “It’s like somebody jumping out of a plane who hasn’t figured out to pull the cord on their parachute—and that’s where I came up with the idea of ‘accidental suicide.’ The fact that it is an oxymoron doesn’t bother me at all.” He theorized that his mother might have taken sleeping pills and then had some sort of panic attack—perhaps she felt that her skin was on fire—and jumped into the water. He went on, “But David tries to big-brother me and outmaneuver me, and the other night he was trying to get me to walk back the ‘accidental suicide’ label and say, Why not ‘accidental drowning’?”"

        "text": "Since the pandemic began, Loftus and Robert have spoken on the phone daily. David joins their calls most weekends. Recently, on a Saturday evening, we all talked together on Zoom. “I’m pretending it’s happy hour,” Loftus said. She sat in her home office, in her three-bedroom condominium in University Hills, a residential complex for faculty at UC Irvine. “So, hey—cheers,” she said. She took a sip of white wine."

        "text": "A few days earlier, I had interviewed their cousin Debbi. “Oh, it was suicide,” she told me when I asked about Rebecca’s death. That I had framed this as a question seemed absurd to her. “We found her, my mother and I,” she said. “We found her in a cold spring. I remember it like it was yesterday.” Debbi had been twelve at the time. Later, her father showed her a suit of his with a bullet hole through one sleeve and explained that Rebecca had initially attempted to kill herself with a gun that he kept in his bedroom closet. “She must have fired it too early,” Debbi told me. “The bullet went through my father’s suit. It was at that point that my parents knew she needed to be institutionalized.”"

        "text": "Debbi hadn’t seen her cousins for years. Loftus asked me what I had learned. “We all would like our memories stimulated, if they can be,” she said, at the beginning of our call.<br><br>I warned them that Debbi did not think there was any ambiguity about their mother’s death. “Maybe there’s a reason you’ve not asked her these questions,” I said. “I don’t want to mess around with your—”<br><br>“Denial system?” Loftus asked.<br><br>“With the way that you’ve made peace with things that happened a long time ago,” I said.<br><br>“I understand that completely,” Loftus said. “In Linda Meyer Williams’s paper”—a 1994 study in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology—“she did not want to tell people, ‘I have records from the hospital that you were abused,’ because, if they were in denial and living with that, maybe it would do something bad to them. But I think we are giving you permission.”"

        "text": "“You have to tell us, or you’re not in our circle of trust anymore,” David joked. He was sitting at his desk in a two-bedroom wooden geodesic dome in Northern California.<br><br>“Yeah, our memories are already polluted to the saturation point,” Robert said.<br><br>I explained that Debbi had been with their aunt Pearl when she found Rebecca’s body—in a cold-water spring, not a pool. I was about to continue when Loftus interrupted, “The swimming pool was a little lake-ish, so I’m not sure I trust that. I mean, if it were in an urban area you would know the difference between a lake and a pool, but in this summer place—what is a pool?”<br><br>“Sounds to me, from the country-property point of view, that our idea of a pool is much different,” Robert said. He had been a math prodigy, the most brilliant of the three children, Loftus had told me. Now his speech had the cadence of someone who had spent his formative years socializing with stoners. He does not have an internet connection, so he was sitting in the trailer of his adult son, Abe, who lives on his property, and was sharing his hot spot. Abe sat next to him, staring out the trailer window."

        "text": "“What else did Debbi remember?” Loftus asked.<br><br>I said that Debbi seemed surprised that anyone believed Rebecca’s death was an accident. “She sort of acted like it was a no-brainer,” I said.<br><br>“If she believes that …” Loftus paused for a few seconds. “I’m not sure she believes it from her own observation or what she would have learned afterward. Debbi was living in the world of the relatives who hated our father, so I don’t think Debbi’s age-twelve observations are—I mean, Debbi’s great, but.” She stopped midsentence.<br><br>The sun was setting in California, and there were few working light bulbs in Abe’s trailer. Robert wore a flannel shirt, unbuttoned, and his image was so dim and grainy that he somehow looked like he was twenty again. He said, “When Beth did the Weinstein case, she was saying that after one of the gals went through the interrogation it sort of massaged her memory in a way to get it to migrate.”<br><br>“You don’t need to bring in Weinstein right now, Robert,” Loftus said, amiably.<br><br>wor“I was sort of thinking of this in terms of how Debbi viewed what happened to Mom,” Robert continued, “and how the general attitude in her home might have affected Debbi’s memory.”"

        "text": "When I had first spoken with David, he mentioned hearing a story about his mother getting hold of his uncle’s gun. I told him that Debbi had heard about a similar incident.<br><br>“That is total news,” Loftus said.<br><br>“Not to me,” David said.<br><br>“How did you know?” Loftus asked him.<br><br>Beyond interactions on social media, David hadn’t had a conversation with Debbi in several decades, and even as children they were not close. “I bet she posted something,” he said. “That’s my only guess. On Instagram. Or Facebook.”<br><br>“Debbi wouldn’t have posted about this on Facebook,” Loftus said.<br><br>“I know—that doesn’t make sense,” David said. “That’s so interesting: when you have such a clear memory and then you go, well, how did I come to know what I believe? And you can’t think of any way in which you could have acquired that knowledge.” David spent five years studying Tibetan Buddhism in a Himalayan village in India, and he seemed well suited to this line of pondering. “Did something happen in a dream and I remembered it as true?” he said."

        "text": "Earlier that day, Loftus had forwarded a scan of her 1959 diary to David. It was the first time he had read her journal, and he was curious about the entry she had written the night before their mother’s death. “Should I read it?” he asked.<br><br>Loftus, who hadn’t read the journal for years, nodded.<br><br>“My mother and I had a long talk until midnight all about her childhood and many other things,” he read. “I was really happy because we’d never been too close before, and now we were talking like we really were.”<br><br>David looked up from the page he was reading. “Beth, are you crying?” he said, tenderly.<br><br>She was. “It’s OK,” she said, nodding quickly and pursing her lips. She had never paid close attention to the timeline. “But if I really was with her until midnight the night before,” she said, “it is a little bit weird that we’re having this really wonderful night and she dies the next day.” The timing had struck me, too. Sometimes, once people resolve to commit suicide, they become uncharacteristically lucid and emotionally expansive, perhaps because the end of their suffering feels near.<br><br>“Was she apprehensive about going back to California—to an intolerable household reality, to the responsibilities of motherhood and parenting?” Robert asked. “I mean, where did I get that infusion of images?”<br><br>“I said that to you because I do believe that,” Loftus said. “But I don’t know where I got that. I have no idea.”<br><br>“If Debbi is sure it is suicide,” Robert said, “it might be that some people come into their experience of mental illness with a baseline rigidity. They can’t relate to mental illness and see these people as extraterrestrial.”<br><br>Robert’s son, Abe, who has had psychiatric treatment, suddenly chimed in: “The first question they ask is ‘Have you had any suicidal thoughts?’ They shame you right off the bat. The minute you get in their office. How can you answer something like that? And then they say you’re depressed because you can’t answer it correctly. That’s just me, though—sorry.”<br><br>“No, it’s OK,” Loftus said. “Abe, is this weird for you?”<br><br>Abe said that he didn’t realize he had relatives who lived in Pennsylvania. Then they reflected on what a child in the 1950s would have understood about mental illness. “We could not fathom it,” Robert said. “We had no metrics.”<br><br>I proposed that maybe there was some truth to the theory of “accidental suicide”; their mother may have been in so much pain that it wasn’t possible to speak of her as having full volition.<br><br>Loftus said that she had a friend, a mother, who had tried to kill herself. “And when I said to her, ‘I can’t believe you did this—do you realize your kids will be still talking about this years later?’ she said, ‘I honestly thought they would be better off without me.’ ” She told her brothers, “Mom could have had that thinking.”<br><br>David recalled a memory of their mother standing at the top of the stairs in a slip when their father came home from work. “Dad yelled at her,” David said. “He said, ‘How can you run around the house naked in front of the children?’ And she cried and ran back into the bedroom.”<br><br>“Oh, wow,” Loftus said. “I never knew you had that.” She had a poorer memory of childhood than her brothers, and she treated their memories as possessions they’d been gifted unfairly.<br><br>Robert, who was now barely visible in the darkness, recalled that Debbi’s father, Harrold, a former marine, had a den where he kept all his paraphernalia from both World Wars. “It’s plausible that Mom would be rummaging around in there, and maybe Harrold had a sidearm in a holster that was draped over one of his uniform jackets, and this could have been what set the stage for this alleged event,” he said. “I don’t buy the fact that she attempted suicide with one of Harrold’s sidearms.”<br><br>David was building a fire, and we could see only his legs. He came back to the screen and said, “Well, the interesting thing is I had this idea, which I never really evaluated, that Dad had thought it was suicide and Mom’s family thought it was some accidental thing. But I think everybody knew it was suicide.”<br><br>“Nope,” Loftus said. “Not everybody.”<br><br>“I’m getting more comfortable with the idea of accidental suicide,” David said.<br><br>“Why?” Loftus said. “I thought you were rejecting Robert’s label.”<br><br>“If somebody dies like that, then you go, ‘Well, I don’t know—I can really think whatever I want,’ ” David said. “But if you then hear there was a previous suicide attempt—”<br><br>“If there was,” Loftus said.<br><br>“Yeah, if there was,” he repeated. “You think Debbi may have misrecollected that?”<br><br>“I think Debbi was twelve years old and what Debbi knows she learned from adults who had their own ideas,” she said. “It’s all these different memories.” Her voice rose in pitch. “And the idea that here we are, in our seventies, trying to sort this out!” She said this like it was funny, but she looked upset. Loftus’s approach to the conversation was so studious that it occurred to me that this call, like the surgery that she turned into a memory experiment in a peer-reviewed journal, might be another way of channeling life events into publishable work."

        "text": "I told Loftus that it seemed hard to avoid the thought that her career had been shaped by the slipperiness of this foundational memory. “No,” she said, shaking her head. “No way. No way. It was purely, got a chance to work with a professor in graduate school on a memory project, got a chance to—no. None of all this.” She asked her brothers, “Would you guys agree?”<br><br>“You’re kind of like Forrest Gump,” David said. “You’re the Forrest Gump of psychology because you just tumble into these situations.”<br><br>“Oh, my God,” Loftus said, laughing, perhaps harder than necessary, because it was such a relief no longer to be talking about her mother. “You know—it is a little Forrest Gump–y. I step into it and suddenly there is Phil Spector, and suddenly there’s Harvey Weinstein and there’s Martha Stewart, you know, and Michael Jackson”—she had assisted with the defense of all four—“and I don’t even know why I’m here. You’re right.”<br><br>“All the people you mention are corrupt,” David said, to no one in particular.<br><br>She said that Spector, who was convicted of murder in 2009, had sent her a beautiful card before he died. It was on the bookshelf behind her."
