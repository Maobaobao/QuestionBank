        "text": "Everyone grieves differently, but even Alex would say he’s further along in the process. “Anthony and I took a really philosophical approach to living,” he says. “That’s why I’m handling my grief very well.” He tells me he feels great, and I believe him. He is buoyant as we walk around San Francisco, pointing out the exterior of their old apartment in the industrial no-man’s-land of Soma. He may be the co-executor of Anthony’s estate, but he says that Anthony feels more like an ex-boyfriend to him now, and that perhaps they would have been better off as friends anyway. Anthony’s family has found his detachment cruel and perplexing. “He really surprise me when he didn’t show that much love when my son died,” says Ravy. “I thought he would be heartbroken like me.”"

        "text": "Alex didn’t have much of a relationship with the Sos when Anthony was alive, which may have been by Anthony’s design. The versions of Anthony they experienced were worlds apart. Alex depicts him as a libertine—together, he says, they lived a “very queer, Bohemian, underground” lifestyle. “There’s just things they wouldn’t know,” he says of Anthony’s family. “His art wasn’t just fueled by sitting in the classroom and being a straight-A student. It was fueled by somewhat chaotic living.”"

        "text": "As modern lovers do, Alex and Anthony met on Grindr. It was Alex’s second quarter at Stanford; he was a nineteen-year-old first year, and Anthony was a super-senior at twenty-two. Their first date took place at the Philz Coffee on Alma Street. Anthony asked him to guess what kind of Asian he was, and he guessed the fancy Asians—Chinese, Japanese, Korean. Wrong! He was a jungle Asian, as Ali Wong, whom Anthony admired, would say. He got up off the couch right there in the coffee shop and asked Alex if he wanted to hear some of his stand-up material. Sure … ? He told the one about how he wished he could tell people he had Tourette’s because of his facial tics. “I’d rather just have Tourette’s than try to stop eye twitching,” he said with a performative slouch."

        "text": "Alex thought he was a dick, and it wasn’t until the second date, when he went to Anthony’s dorm room, that he could see past the shtick: He looked at Anthony’s photographs, print transfers, and sketches. He was taken by a self-portrait with text that read, “I have food, I have shelter, I have water.” Things clicked into place; he understood that even the jokes were Anthony’s way of telling you about himself. “We had a real powerful ability to be moved by aesthetic experiences. All of a sudden I felt like I understood something about him that other people didn’t get,” he says. “We instantly fell in love. It was effortless.”"

        "text": "From that point on, Anthony and Alex became the kind of couple that shared everything. “They did enter into this world where you knew they were a package deal,” says Quintana. They wore the same clothing, shoes, underwear even. Alex thought they were like Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas or Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith. They read each other’s work voraciously: When Alex was writing about Emily Dickinson for his undergraduate thesis, Anthony would recite poems like “Wild Nights—Wild Nights!” aloud. When Anthony began writing fiction in earnest, Alex became his first reader and executioner, axing pieces he thought weren’t worth it. “There would be no book without Alex,” Anthony writes in the acknowledgments. “Thank you for showing me that a queer Cambo from Stockton, California, could find a wealth of commonality with a queer half-Mexican kid from rural Illinois. I don’t think I could’ve finished this book without knowing that. I love you. You wrote these stories with me.”"

        "text": "Alex still wears Anthony’s clothes, including the dotted T-shirt and brown Doc Martens he has on when I meet him at his one-bedroom apartment in the Mission. His new place is just a couple of blocks away from the one they shared, and it is filled with Anthony’s personal effects: a glass cupboard arranged with photographs and Afterparties like a miniature shrine; a cracked mug he loved; a hospital-blue bookshelf Anthony insisted on taking from California to New York and back again; all manner of notes and marginalia; old issues of The Stanford Chaparral. Anthony drew one cover in the style of the New Yorker as a way of declaring that he would one day be in its pages. “Everyone’s like, ‘Shut up, Anthony, you’re not going to be in the New Yorker. You’re a computer-science major,’ ” says Alex. When the magazine published his short story “Three Women of Chuck’s Donuts” in February 2020, he remembers Anthony said “ ‘I told you I was right.’ ” He adds, “Anthony had this sort of arrogance about him that was usually accurate.”"

        "passage_number": 7,
        "text": "Alex’s version of Anthony is spikier than others’, with more effervescent highs and crushing lows. From the time they met, he says, Anthony loved to party; he was a social ringleader, loud, outlandish. He polarized the girlies; people loved him or hated him, but at least they felt something. He did what you’d classify as circuit gay drugs: coke, ketamine, molly. “He didn’t have a sense of boundaries and restrictions, like hooking up with somebody he shouldn’t hook up with or pressuring people to do drugs,” says Alex. “He had that ethos about him, picking anybody to do a drug. I think he was toxic in certain ways. The problem is people thought he was funny. People liked having him around.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 8,
        "text": "Alex speaks quickly, volubly, and incessantly; the way he talks about Anthony feels like a way to talk about himself. After Anthony died, he began pitching himself to his publicist and agent as someone who could help editorially. He has been a little aimless anyway—he dropped out of his Ph.D. program in English at Berkeley—and this gave him purpose. Now he’s getting assignments. He wrote the foreword for a posthumous piece by Anthony about never finishing books for The Millions; he wrote another about Anthony’s creative process for Poets & Writers; he published one about their relationship in BuzzFeed that he’s “super-excited about.” He asks me if I can get him a job—“just kidding.” “I didn’t have any Twitter followers before this. Now, I have over a thousand. I had my first tweet go viral,” he says, referencing one in which he says that holding galleys of Afterparties was like “meeting our child for the first time.”"

        "text": "“I tell people it felt like I woke up when he passed,” Alex continues. “I was in a spinoff in my old life in a way, rather than the main character now, which I didn’t really want.” Despite what he saw as his partner’s flaws, he also saw him as a mentor, and I get the distinct sensation he is trying to become his own version of Anthony. Alex tells me he thinks he could be the one to finish Anthony’s novel, Straight Thru Cambotown, because he knew him so well—“but there’s a lot of the politics and ethics around me not being Cambodian American writing that book.”"
      },
      {
        "passage_number": 10,
        "text": "The closer we get to discussing the night of Anthony’s death, the vaguer Alex becomes. He says that in the months prior, their partnership was fracturing. Anthony’s single-minded focus on completing the book was so all-consuming it was burning up all the oxygen in their relationship. He says that Anthony would have nightmares about the genocide and talk about it. “You don’t always want to be thinking about Pol Pot,” he says. “Being in his creative space was very difficult. I needed a break from it.” He was starting to feel like a muse trapped in amber. “Sometimes I feel like he was Hades, and I was Persephone,” he continues. “Like if I left him, he would do something bad. There was a lot of concern there.” He alludes to horrific things—things he told the family and their mutual friends that have caused rifts in those relationships—but he won’t elaborate on them."
