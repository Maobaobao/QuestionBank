        "text": "Humans have been lumbering around the planet for only a half million years, the only species young and arrogant enough to name ourselves sapiens in genus Homo. We share a common ancestor with gorillas and whales and sea squirts, marine invertebrates that swim freely in their larval phase before attaching to rocks or shells and later eating their own brain. The kingdom Animalia, in which we reside, is an offshoot of the domain Eukarya, which includes every life-form on Earth with a nucleus—humans and sea squirts, fungi, plants, and slime molds that are ancient by comparison with us—and all these relations occupy the slenderest tendril of a vast and astonishing web that pulsates all around us and beyond our comprehension."

        "text": "The most recent taxonomies—those based on genetic evidence that evolution is not a single lineage, but multiple lineages, not a branch that culminates in a species at its distant tip, but a network of convergences—have moved away from their histories as trees and chains and ladders. Instead, they now look more like sprawling, networked webs that trace the many points of relation back to ever more ancient origins, beyond our knowledge or capacity for knowing, in pursuit of the 'universal ancestors,' life-forms that came before metabolism, before self-replication—the several-billion-year-old plasmodial blobs from which all life on Earth evolved. We haven’t found evidence for them yet, but we know what we’re looking for: they would be simple, small, and strange."

        "text": "A few years ago, near a rural village in Myanmar, miners came across a piece of amber containing a fossilized Stemonitis slime mold dating from the mid-Cretaceous period. Scientists were thrilled by the discovery, because few slime mold fossils exist, and noted that the one-hundred-million-year-old Stemonitis looks indistinguishable from the one oozing around forests today. Perhaps slime mold hasn’t evolved much in that time, they speculated. Recent genetic analyses have suggested that slime molds are perhaps as old as one or two billion years—which would make them hundreds of millions of years older than plants and would mean they pulled themselves out of the ocean on their cellbows at a time when the only land species were giant mats of bacteria."

        "text": "One special ability of slime molds that supports this possibility is their capacity for cryptobiosis: the process of exchanging all the water in one’s body for sugars, allowing a creature to enter a kind of stasis for weeks, months, years, centuries, perhaps even for millennia. Slime molds can enter stasis at any stage in their life cycle—as an amoeba, as a plasmodium, as a spore—whenever their environment or the climate does not suit their preferences or needs. The only other species who have this ability are the so-called 'living fossils' such as tardigrades and Notostraca (commonly known as water bears and tadpole shrimp, respectively). The ability to become dormant until conditions are more favorable for life might be one of the reasons slime mold has survived as long as it has, through dozens of geologic periods, countless ice ages, and the extinction events that have repeatedly wiped out nearly all life on Earth."

        "text": "Slime mold might not have evolved much in the past two billion years, but it has learned a few things during that time. In laboratory environments, researchers have cut Physarum polycephalum into pieces and found that it can fuse back together within two minutes. Or each piece can go off and live its separate life, learn new things, and return later to fuse together, and in the fusing, each individual can teach the other what it knows, and can learn from it in return."

A single cell might look to us like a coherent whole, but that cell can divide itself into countless spores, creating countless possible cycles of amoeba to plasmodium to aethalia, which in turn will divide and repeat the cycle again. It can choose to 'fruit' or not, to reproduce sexually or asexually or not at all, challenging every traditional concept of 'species,' the most basic and fundamental unit of our flawed and imprecise understanding of the biological world."

        "text": "As a consequence, we have no way of knowing whether slime molds, as a broad class of beings, are stable or whether climate change threatens their survival, as it does our own. Without a way to count their population as a species, we can’t measure whether they are endangered or thriving. Should individuals that produce similar fruiting bodies be considered a species? What if two separate slime molds do not mate but share genetic material? The very idea of separateness seems antithetical to slime mold existence. It has so much to teach us."

        "text": "In 1973, in a suburb of Dallas, a sudden, particularly spectacular appearance of Fuligo septica across lawns sparked a panic. Firemen blasted the plasmodia with water, breaking the creatures to pieces, but those pieces continued to slime around and grow larger. The townspeople speculated that an indestructible alien species had invaded Earth, perhaps recalling the plot of the 1958 movie The Blob starring a young Steve McQueen. Scientists arrived in the panicked neighborhood to take samples, reassuring the community that what they had experienced was just a stage in the life cycle of a poorly understood organism: 'a common worldwide occurrence,' they said. 'Texas scientists think backyard blob is dead,' read a headline in the New York Times."

The aethalia is pale, hardened, and calcified, with the texture and color of a summer cast protecting a child’s broken arm, browned by a season without washing. A breath of wind arrives and black dust lifts from the slime mold’s surface, blown toward the edge of my yard, and the next one over. And the next."

        "text": "Spring in Houston is the season for working in the garden. We replant our tall ornamental grasses, killed in the recent unseasonable freeze; ours are a hybrid Pennisetum species, from the family Poaceae, a large taxonomic group that also contains Zea (a genus that includes corn), Oryza (rice), Saccharum (sugar cane), and Triticum (wheat). Fungi live on and among these plants, bringing them water and nourishment through the threadlike mycelium to keep them alive and aiding their decomposition when they die. As the plants decompose, they provide the food that bacteria eat, and myxomycete amoeba prey on these bacteria when they hatch from their spores. We plunge our shovels and hands in the dirt, the living substrate—alive in ways I have only just begun to fathom. We plant the grasses, fill the holes, lay down fresh mulch. We collect our tools and retreat indoors to the comforts of our home—our refrigerated food, our instant oatmeal, our beloved air-conditioning."
