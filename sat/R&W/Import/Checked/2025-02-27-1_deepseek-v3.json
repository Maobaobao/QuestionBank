        "text": "The casting director puts it bluntly: 'A lot of the children of famous people are not good.' How often are they meeting with them? 'God, there have been so many over the course of my life.' They once met with an aspiring actress who was the daughter of two movie stars. 'There was something else that walked in the room with her,' they say. 'Like, ‘My parents are famous, and I’m here because somebody told me to meet you.’ A lovely person but definitely a sense of entitlement. She left, and I was like, That person doesn’t excite me. The struggle isn’t there.' This is not always a deal breaker. Afterward, the daughter booked the role that made her a household name."

        "text": "Despite suspicions, you don’t always know someone’s background. A while back, a young actress with a famous family but a common last name came in to read for her first lead role. 'I had no idea who she was,' says the casting director. 'I don’t know why I didn’t get the memo. From my vantage point, she won that job fair and square.' (The actress’s performance was widely acclaimed, and she became a major star.)"

        "text": "The casting director laments changes in the industry that have perhaps enabled the nepo babies’ rise. 'I don’t think people know or understand what acting is anymore,' they say. With the advent of streaming and social media, the big screen no longer rules. 'A lot of these people watch this crap, and they think that what they’re watching is good acting, and they mimic what that is,' the casting director says. 'And it’s not good.' That devolution explains why it may feel as though there are so many more well-born mediocrities than ever before: the medium’s standards are merely lower."

        "text": "We need not sign on to the fiction that nepo babies actually have it worse to acknowledge that there are elements of their lives we wouldn’t trade for our own. 'Nobody treats you seriously,' filmmaker Owen Kline (son of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates) told The Guardian in September. 'No one wants to read someone’s kid’s ‘thing.’ ' Others taking you seriously doesn’t necessarily cure the anxiety. 'For a long time, I wondered whether my career had come to me because of my own talents or because of some kind of genteel nepotism,' a thirty-something Jeff Bridges told the authors of Hollywood Dynasties. 'The guilt caused big problems for me.'"

        "text": "The casting director can empathize: 'How do you know if somebody really likes you?' Some nepo babies take this vulnerability and use it—the struggle is the spice that finally makes them interesting. 'And others, it’s the thing that gets in their way.'"

        "text": "The casting director can empathize: 'How do you know if somebody really likes you?' Some nepo babies take this vulnerability and use it—the struggle is the spice that finally makes them interesting. 'And others, it’s the thing that gets in their way.'<br><br>The industry’s original nepo baby was Douglas Fairbanks Jr., son of Douglas Sr. and stepson of Mary Pickford, who in the 1920s were arguably the most famous couple on the planet. Sensing the power of a good name, Paramount’s Jesse L. Lasky handed the thirteen-year-old a $1,000-a-week contract and set about trying to make him a star. Like many who followed in his footsteps, Fairbanks Jr. never came close to equaling his father’s legacy, but he had a long career, was briefly married to Joan Crawford, and seemed entirely at ease with his station in life. 'I have, since maturity, known full well the limits of my capabilities,' he wrote in his memoir. The younger Fairbanks, who was mobbed by adoring throngs upon his arrival in Los Angeles, likely escaped the backlash that hits today’s nepo babies, though presumably there were a few bitchy telegrams sent about him."

        "text": "Those who came after were often treated as tragic figures. Take Frank Sinatra Jr.: While Frank hung out with criminals in a cool way, Junior did it in an extremely uncool way. (He got kidnapped.) It wasn’t until the late sixties, when second-gen stars like Liza Minnelli and Jane Fonda came onto the scene, that the first celebrity kids were able to climb out of Hollywood’s primordial soup and carve identities apart from their lineage. Each was aided by a natural divide separating them from their famous parent: Fonda by working in Europe, an ocean away from America, Minnelli by the somewhat more dramatic distance between the living and the dead."

        "text": "Long before TikTok got ahold of these descendants, scholars had been studying our obsession with multigenerational stars. Austrian academic Eva Maria Schörgenhuber argues that celebrity children function as living links to a shared pop-culture history, connecting us to a nostalgic vision of the past. You can see this keenly in the types of nepo babies the culture does not have a problem with. Stars like Minnelli, Mariska Hargitay, or Freddie Prinze Jr., who all had a parent die in tragic circumstances, garner respect, not scorn, for following in their footsteps. The same way the Kennedys went from nouveau-riche bootleggers to inhabitants of a fairy-tale castle, so does the passage of time transform a nepo baby into someone 'from a famous family.' Few today care that Michael Douglas, Laura Dern, or Tracee Ellis Ross had celebrity parents. The same principle holds true for someone like Dakota Johnson, who reps multiple generations of Hollywood legends and is thus exempt from the tasteless striving that defines celebrity children of a more recent vintage. Paradoxically, the nepo babies we like best are often the ones who are most privileged."

        "text": "The director Luca Guadagnino, who cast Johnson in two of his films, once told me, 'I can see Tippi Hedren' in her. He glimpsed flickers of her grandmother, the great Hitchcock blonde. We often talk about the 'It' factor, the otherworldly charisma that stars like Clara Bow exhibited in front of a camera. As the career of Chet Hanks makes abundantly clear, this quality is not guaranteed to be passed down through the generations. But it can be off-putting to discover that 'It' may indeed be hereditary, to see a Zoë Kravitz or Kate Hudson display that same intangible sparkle you saw in their parents. 'They walk in the room, and they have this thing,' says the casting director. 'They just know. They literally know. You’re drawn to that, and you’re a little bit afraid of it. Because it’s bigger than you.'"
