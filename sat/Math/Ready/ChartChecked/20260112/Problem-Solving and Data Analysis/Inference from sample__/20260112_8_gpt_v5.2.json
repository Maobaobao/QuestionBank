      "question": "A company wants to estimate the proportion of its customers who would be interested in a new subscription service. The company considers three different sampling plans.<br>Plan <math><mn>1</mn></math>: Survey customers who visit the company\u2019s website during one day.<br>Plan <math><mn>2</mn></math>: Survey a simple random sample of customers from a list of all customers.<br>Plan <math><mn>3</mn></math>: Survey customers who respond to an email invitation asking for feedback about the new service.<br>Which plan is most appropriate for making an inference about the proportion of all customers who would be interested in the new subscription service?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Plan <math><mn>1</mn></math>, because only current website visitors are likely to use the service.",
        "B": "Plan <math><mn>2</mn></math>, because a simple random sample of all customers is most representative.",
        "C": "Plan <math><mn>3</mn></math>, because customers who respond to the email are most interested in the service.",

      "question": "Two surveys are conducted to estimate the proportion of students at a high school who bring their own lunch.

Survey <math><mn>2</mn></math> uses a random sample of <math><mn>1200</mn></math> students and has a margin of error of <math><mo>&#xb1;</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>%</mo></math>. Both surveys find the same sample proportion of students who bring their own lunch. Which statement best explains why Survey <math><mn>2</mn></math> has a smaller margin of error?",
      "options": {

The scientist takes a random sample of <math><mn>400</mn></math> fish and finds that <math><mn>36</mn><mo>%</mo></math> of them are infected. The scientist reports an estimate for the proportion of all fish in the lake that are infected, with a margin of error of <math><mo>&#xb1;</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>%</mo></math>.
