## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | focus_domains lists only ["Problem-Solving and Data Analysis"], but actual questions include "Algebra", "Advanced Math", "Geometry and Trigonometry". | Update focus_domains to ["Problem-Solving and Data Analysis", "Algebra", "Advanced Math", "Geometry and Trigonometry"]. |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | focus_skills lists only ["Evaluating statistical claims: Observational studies and experiments"], but actual skills are diverse (e.g., "Linear equations in 1 variable", "Nonlinear functions"). | Update focus_skills to include all unique skills: ["Evaluating statistical claims: Observational studies and experiments", "Linear equations in 1 variable", "Linear functions", "Nonlinear equations in 1 variable", "Area and volume formulas", "Percentages", "Nonlinear functions", "Right triangles and trigonometry", "Two-variable data: models and scatter-plots", "Lines, angles, and triangles", "Equivalent expressions"]. |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | difficulty_distribution: {"easy": 4, "medium": 6, "hard": 10}, but actual counts: Easy=4, Medium=7, Hard=9. | Update to {"easy": 4, "medium": 7, "hard": 9}. |
| 1-10 | No Issues | Questions 1-10 are consistent, answers correct, explanations direct and accurate. No math expressions needing <math> tags. | No change needed. |
| 11 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation uses <math> tags correctly, but ensure consistency. Answer verified correct (x=6). | No change needed. |
| 12 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation correct, but slope as "0.5" in answer; explanation mentions fraction. Consistent. | No change needed. |
| 13 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation correct, positive solution 7 verified. | No change needed. |
| 14 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expression "Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 8 * 5 = 20." not in <math> tags. | Wrap in <math>: <math><mi>Area</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>×</mo><mi>base</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>height</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>×</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn></math>. |
| 15 | Explanation Flaw | Calculations "200 * 1.15 = 230. Then: 230 * 0.9 = 207." not in <math> tags. | Wrap: First: <math><mn>200</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1.15</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>230</mn></math>. Then: <math><mn>230</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>0.9</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>207</mn></math>. |
| 16 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation correct, <math> used. | No change needed. |
| 17 | No Issues | Pythagorean theorem application correct, <math> used. | No change needed. |
| 18 | Chart Mismatch | question_chart_description says "negative linear trend", but current SVG shows positive trend (points move up-right). | Confirmed with code parse; to match text, update SVG circles to cy='50', '100', '150', '200' (increasing cy for negative graph trend). Update line to x1='50' y1='50' x2='350' y2='250' for down-right. |
| 18 | Chart Mismatch | explanation_chart_svg has same issue as question_chart_svg. | Apply same updates as above. |
| 18 | Explanation Flaw | Points listed as (50,200), (100,150), (150,100), (200,50); but to match slope -0.5 with delta x=100 implied by scale, points should be (100,200), (200,150), (300,100), (400,50). Slope verified as -0.5. | Update points in explanation to (100,200), (200,150), (300,100), (400,50). |
| 18 | Mathematical Error | Slope described as -0.5, correct for updated points; model y = -0.5x + 250 fits perfectly (verified: for x=100, y=200; etc.). | No further change; updates fix consistency. |
| 18 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation does not use <math> for equation. | Wrap model as <math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>-</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>250</mn></math>. |
| 19 | Chart Accuracy | SVG coordinates imply 45° angles (tan^{-1}(1)=45°), but labeled 50°; figures not to scale, ok. Description accurate. | No change needed. |
| 19 | Mathematical Error | Answer "40" does not match logic; with angle ABD=50°, isosceles ABC, base angles 40°, total angle at B=100°, bisected to 50° each, so x=50°. | Change answer to "50". |
| 19 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation contains forbidden chain-of-thought ("Wait, but answer is 40...", "perhaps not isosceles", etc.); must be direct textbook style. | Rewrite to: "Since BD is perpendicular to AC, angles ADB and CDB are 90°. In triangle ABD, the angles sum to 180°, the angle at D is 90°, and the angle at B is 50°, so the angle at A is 40°. Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC, the base angles at A and C are equal, each 40°. In triangle CBD, the angle at C is 40°, the angle at D is 90°, so the angle at B (x) is 50°." |
| 19 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expressions (e.g., "angles sum to 180°") not in <math> tags. | Wrap angles and sums, e.g., <math><mn>180</mn><mo>°</mo></math>, but since text-heavy, add where appropriate. |
| 19 | Difficulty Mismatch | Hard appropriate for insight into isosceles properties and angle bisect. | No change. |
| 20 | JSON Structure | Invalid MathML in question: <mfrac> missing denominator child; renders as invalid. | Update to <math><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>16</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac></math>. |
| 20 | Explanation Flaw | Invalid MathML in explanation, similar issue. | Update to "Factor the numerator: <math><mfrac><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac></math> = <math><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn></math>." |
| All | Typo/Grammar | Minor text quality: e.g., consistent capitalization, no issues in most, but ensure. | No major changes. |
| All | SVG Formatting | SVGs use double quotes for attributes; preference for single quotes to minimize escaping. | Update all SVG strings to use single quotes (e.g., width='400'). |
| All | No Issues | question_type_distribution matches (MCQ=15, SPR=5). total_questions=20 matches. No syntactic JSON errors. | No change. |
| 13 | Difficulty Mismatch | Solving quadratic by factoring is medium complexity (direct application), not hard. | Change difficulty to "Medium" (updates distribution: medium=8, hard=8). |
| 16 | Difficulty Mismatch | Identifying vertex from vertex form is easy. | Change to "Easy" (easy=5, hard=8). |
## Metadata Consistency Findings
- focus_domains and focus_skills are too narrow; updated to reflect all questions.
- difficulty_distribution mismatched counts; corrected.
- All questions map to SAT domains/skills appropriately, no incomplete mappings.

# SAT Math Question Difficulty Auditor Report

### 1. Difficulty Distribution Summary
- **Declared Distribution:** Easy: 4, Medium: 6, Hard: 10 (as per `test_metadata`)
- **Audited Distribution:** Easy: 6, Medium: 11, Hard: 3
- **Alignment Score:** 65% (13 out of 20 questions correctly labeled)

### 2. Mislabeled Questions Log

| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6 | Hard | Medium | The question requires identifying the sampled population (sixth-graders at the school) and generalizing only to that group. This combines basic sampling concepts with option evaluation but involves only 2 steps and no non-obvious insight; distractors are present but not dense. |
| 8 | Hard | Medium | Generalizing results from a sample at one high school to that school's students involves straightforward application of sampling principles with moderate cognitive load (2 steps: identify population, limit scope), not abstract or complex modeling. |
| 13 | Hard | Medium | Factoring a simple quadratic (x² - 6x - 7 = 0) and selecting the positive root requires combining factoring technique with root identification (2-3 steps), but it's a standard nonlinear equation without parameters or pitfalls. |
| 16 | Hard | Easy | Identifying the vertex from vertex form (x - 3)² + 4 is direct recall of a single concept (vertex at (h, k)), with 1 step and low cognitive load. |
| 17 | Medium | Easy | Applying the Pythagorean theorem to legs 5 and 12 (recognizing 5-12-13 triple) is direct use of a single formula, 1-2 straightforward steps, familiar setup. |
| 18 | Hard | Medium | Interpreting a scatterplot to select the best linear model involves estimating slope and intercept (2-3 steps: identify trend, calculate/estimate parameters, match options), moderate load with visual translation but no deep insight. |
| 19 | Hard | Medium | Calculating the angle using right triangle sums and recognizing isosceles properties from the figure requires combining angle rules and symmetry (3 steps: find angle at A, infer base angles, sum in second triangle), moderate complexity but not abstract or distractor-heavy. |
