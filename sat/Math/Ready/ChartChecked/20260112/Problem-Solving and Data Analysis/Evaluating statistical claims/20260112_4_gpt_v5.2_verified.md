## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency (Critical) | `question_type_distribution` declares 15 MCQ and 5 SPR, but the file contains 16 MCQ and 4 SPR. | Convert one MCQ to an SPR (kept as Q20) so the file contains exactly 15 MCQ and 5 SPR. |
| 1–15 | JSON Structure | `additional_data` field is missing for 15 questions (Q1–Q15). | Add `"additional_data": null` to Q1–Q15. |
| 10 | MathML Compliance | The explanation includes “62%” outside `<math>` tags. | Wrap the percentage in MathML: `<math><mn>62</mn><mo>%</mo></math>`. |
| 16, 19 | MathML Compliance | The explanations include percent statements (e.g., “50%”, “60%”) outside `<math>` tags. | Wrap all percent expressions in MathML, including the quoted claim text in Q19. |

# Difficulty Audit Report

Source JSON audited for difficulty: `d:\TraeRepo\SAT-AI\QuestionBank\Math\Create\20260112\Problem-Solving and Data Analysis\Evaluating statistical claims\20260112_4_gpt_v5.2.json`

## 1. Difficulty Distribution Summary
- Declared Distribution: Easy 4, Medium 6, Hard 10
- Audited Distribution: Easy 12, Medium 8, Hard 0
- Alignment Score: 40% (8/20)

## 2. Mislabeled Questions Log
| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7 | Medium | Easy | Directly identifies lack of random assignment as the limitation; one-step concept check. |
| 9 | Medium | Easy | Standard “correlation does not imply causation” recognition; minimal reasoning. |
| 11 | Hard | Medium | Observational headline critique; single core idea (no random assignment → no causation) with moderate reading. |
| 12 | Hard | Medium | Clustered random assignment limitation is a conceptual nuance but not multi-step or “unlock” style reasoning. |
| 13 | Hard | Medium | Identifies that two treatment components changed together; straightforward experimental-design flaw. |
| 14 | Hard | Easy | Recognizes volunteer/convenience sampling bias; direct concept recall. |
| 15 | Hard | Medium | Selects random assignment + placebo as best causal-strengthening step; moderate experimental-design understanding. |
| 16 | Hard | Easy | Routine percent reduction computation from two simple rates; no non-obvious insight. |
| 17 | Hard | Easy | Routine percent increase computation <math><mfrac><mn>6</mn><mn>80</mn></mfrac></math>; minimal steps. |
| 18 | Hard | Easy | Straight subtraction of two proportions; routine arithmetic. |
| 19 | Hard | Easy | Routine percent reduction computation; minimal steps and clean numbers. |
| 20 | Hard | Easy | Identifies plausible confounder (family income/access) in an observational comparison; direct concept. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis (Optional)
- Borderline Easy/Medium: Q5, Q6, and Q10 could be argued as Easy because each tests a single idea, but the wording requires careful distinction (causation vs generalization; blinding; sampling vs assignment), which supports a Medium label.
- Borderline Medium/Hard: Q12 is the closest to Hard due to cluster/within-school similarity nuance, but it remains a single conceptual checkpoint rather than a high-cognitive-load “unlock” problem.
