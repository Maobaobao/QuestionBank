## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | focus_domains ["Advanced Math", "Algebra"] do not cover all questions (e.g., Q4, Q10, Q15, Q16, Q20 use "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis" or "Geometry and Trigonometry"). focus_skills ["Nonlinear functions", "Linear functions"] mismatched in many (e.g., Q4 "Percentages", Q9 "Systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables", Q10 "Right triangles and trigonometry"). | Update focus_domains to ["Advanced Math", "Algebra", "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis", "Geometry and Trigonometry"]; focus_skills to ["Nonlinear functions", "Linear functions", "Percentages", "Systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables", "Right triangles and trigonometry", "Systems of equations in 2 variables", "Inference from sample statistics and margin of error", "Circles", "Equivalent expressions", "Linear inequalities in 1 or 2 variables", "Nonlinear equations in 1 variable", "Two-variable data: models and scatterplots"]. |
| 1 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Nonlinear functions" but question involves a linear graph and interpretation. | Change skill to "Linear functions". |
| 2 | Content & Typo Audit | question_chart_description includes editing note "but shifted in the description." | Remove the phrase ", but shifted in the description." |
| 4 | Metadata Inconsistency | Domain "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis" and skill "Percentages" not in focus. | Covered in metadata correction above. |
| 9 | Mathematical Error | Question system (2x + y = 8, x - 3y = -5) solves to x = 19/7, not in options; explanation describes different system (3x + 2y = 8, x + y = 3) with x = 2; answer "A" (1) incorrect for both. Explanation style has no forbidden chain-of-thought. | Update question to "Solve the system: <math><mn>3</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>8</mn></math>, <math><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></math>. What is <math><mi>x</mi></math>?"; change answer to "B"; update explanation to "From the second equation, x = 3 - y. Substitute into the first: 3(3 - y) + 2y = 8 → 9 - 3y + 2y = 8 → 9 - y = 8 → y = 1. Then x = 3 - 1 = 2." |
| 9 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables" not in focus_skills. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 10 | Metadata Inconsistency | Domain "Geometry and Trigonometry" and skill "Right triangles and trigonometry" not in focus. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 11 | Mathematical Error | Question product 528 but explanation uses 224 (correct for integer solution y=8); disc for 528 not perfect square, no integer solutions despite "positive integers". Explanation has no forbidden content. | Change question product to 224: "The product of two positive integers is 224. If the first is 4 greater than three times the second, what is the smaller integer?" |
| 12 | Mathematical Error | Question defines f(x) = a/x - 15, product f(10) f(6) (depends on a); explanation uses g(z) = a/z -25, product g(2a) g(7a) = 609 (independent of a). Answer 609 matches explanation but not question. | Update question to "The function g is defined by g(z) = a/z -25, where <math><mi>a</mi><mo><</mo><mn>0</mn></math>. What is the product of g(2a) and g(7a)?"; update function in explanation to match. |
| 13 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Nonlinear functions" but question is linear function. | Change skill to "Linear functions". |
| 14 | Mathematical Error | Question x^2 + y^2 =29 solves to non-integer x; explanation uses =17 with x=1 or 4; answer "D" (4) matches explanation but not question. | Change question to "<math><mi>x</mi><msup><mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><msup><mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>17</mn></math>"; update explanation to match =17. |
| 14 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Systems of equations in 2 variables" not in focus_skills. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 15 | Metadata Inconsistency | Domain "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis" and skill "Inference from sample statistics and margin of error" not in focus. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 16 | Metadata Inconsistency | Domain "Geometry and Trigonometry" and skill "Circles" not in focus. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 16 | Difficulty Mismatch | Labeled "Hard" but simple probability (1/4), direct application; fits "Easy". | Change difficulty to "Easy". (Note: Adjusts distribution; easy:5, hard:9.) |
| 16 | Chart Mismatch | question_chart_svg has r=100 but question says radius 8; scaled but inconsistent. Quadrant area correct regardless. | Update question to radius consistent with SVG or ignore as scaling issue; no change needed for math. |
| 17 | Difficulty Mismatch | Labeled "Hard" but basic rational simplification; fits "Medium". | Change difficulty to "Medium". (Note: Adjusts distribution; medium:7, hard:8.) |
| 17 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Equivalent expressions" not in focus_skills. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 18 | Mathematical Error | Question inequalities (2x-3>5 → x>4; x+1<4 → x<3) have no solution; explanation uses 2x-3>1 (x>2), x+1<5 (x<4), with 3 satisfying; answer "C" (3) matches explanation. | Update question to "Which value of x satisfies <math><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>></mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> and <math><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo><</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></math>?"; update explanation to "2x - 3 > 1 → 2x > 4 → x > 2. x + 1 < 5 → x < 4. So 2 < x < 4, and 3 satisfies." |
| 18 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Linear inequalities in 1 or 2 variables" not in focus_skills. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 19 | Metadata Inconsistency | Skill "Nonlinear equations in 1 variable" not in focus_skills. | Covered in metadata correction. |
| 20 | Chart Mismatch | question_chart_description says "negative linear correlation" but SVG points (cy decreasing with cx increasing) and flipped y-scale indicate positive (higher scores right); context (hours studied vs score) expects positive. Explanation has forbidden chain-of-thought ("wait, in my SVG... Fix description..."). Answer "A" (positive) correct for context/SVG. | Update description to "Scatterplot with points showing positive linear correlation, with a line of best fit."; clean explanation to "The points rise from left to right, indicating a positive linear correlation." |
| 20 | Metadata Inconsistency | Domain "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis" and skill "Two-variable data: models and scatterplots" not in focus. | Covered in metadata correction. |

## Metadata Consistency Findings
- total_questions, difficulty_distribution, and question_type_distribution match the questions array exactly.
- focus_domains and focus_skills only partially match; many questions fall outside, as detailed in issues. This is a significant mismatch, likely due to incomplete metadata declaration.

# SAT Math Question Difficulty Auditor Report

### 1. Difficulty Distribution Summary
- **Declared Distribution:** Easy: 4, Medium: 6, Hard: 10
- **Audited Distribution:** Easy: 9, Medium: 9, Hard: 2
- **Alignment Score:** 50% (10 out of 20 questions correctly labeled)

### 2. Mislabeled Questions Log

| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7 | Medium | Easy | Factoring a simple quadratic (x² - 9x + 14 = 0) to find roots requires direct application of a single concept; 1-2 steps with no integration or insight needed. |
| 10 | Medium | Easy | Direct recall of 30-60-90 triangle ratios; single step to double the opposite side for hypotenuse. Standard and familiar. |
| 13 | Hard | Easy | The table directly provides g(0) = 4, which is the y-intercept; confirming linearity with slope is optional and straightforward. Minimal steps. |
| 14 | Hard | Medium | Substitution of linear into quadratic leads to a solvable equation; 2-3 steps involving expansion and factoring, but path is clear without novel insight. |
| 15 | Hard | Medium | Interpreting margin of error requires understanding a statistical concept in context; moderate load with 2 steps (identify range, apply to proportion). |
| 16 | Hard | Easy | Simple area ratio (quadrant to circle) yields 1/4; direct application of geometry formulas with 1 step. |
| 17 | Hard | Easy | Factoring numerator and canceling common factor in rational expression; basic algebra skill, 1-2 steps. |
| 18 | Hard | Medium | Solving two linear inequalities and finding intersection; 2 steps per inequality, then combine, with moderate organization. |
| 19 | Hard | Medium | Using Vieta's formulas for sum of roots in cubic; direct recall or simple factoring, 1-2 steps with moderate conceptual integration. |
| 20 | Hard | Easy | Observing trend in scatterplot (positive linear); direct visual interpretation, no calculation or multi-step reasoning. |

### 3. Detailed Analysis (Optional)
- Q8 is borderline Easy/Medium due to horizontal shifts sometimes confusing direction (add vs. subtract), but aligns well with Medium as it combines function transformation knowledge.
- Q11 and Q12 are particularly well-calibrated as Hard, requiring setup insight and parameter independence, respectively, with high cognitive load.
