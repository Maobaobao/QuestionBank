## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 18 | MathML Validation | Explanation used non-standard `<mangle>` tags inside `<math>...</math>`, which is not valid MathML. | Replaced `<mangle>` usage with standard MathML tokens using `<mo>∠</mo>...` and added degree symbols consistently. (Applied in JSON.) |
| 16 | Difficulty Mismatch (Warning) | Labeled Hard, but it is a direct one-step “alternate interior angles are congruent” fact. | Recommendation: relabel as Easy (not applied to preserve the requested 4/6/10 distribution). |
| 12 | Difficulty Mismatch (Warning) | Labeled Hard, but it is a straightforward angle-bisector + triangle sum problem. | Recommendation: relabel as Easy/Medium (not applied). |
| 18 | Difficulty Mismatch (Warning) | Labeled Hard, but it is basic angle addition + triangle sum. | Recommendation: relabel as Easy/Medium (not applied). |
| 15 | Difficulty Mismatch (Warning) | Labeled Hard, but it is a routine triangle angle-sum equation with a right angle. | Recommendation: relabel as Medium (not applied). |
| 14 | Difficulty Mismatch (Warning) | Labeled Hard, but it is standard isosceles-base-angle + angle bisector partition. | Recommendation: relabel as Medium (not applied). |

## Metadata Consistency Findings
- `focus_domains` and `focus_skills` match all questions’ `domain` and `skill` fields.
- `total_questions` matches the length of the `questions` array (20).
- Declared distributions match computed tallies:
  - Difficulty: Easy 4, Medium 6, Hard 10
  - Type: MCQ 15, SPR 5

## Mathematical Correctness & Internal Consistency
- Answer verification: All 20 answers are mathematically consistent with their questions and explanations.
- MCQ option integrity: No missing/duplicate answer keys detected; correct answers map to provided options.
- SPR integrity: `options` is `null` for all SPR items.

## MathML / SVG / Formatting Checks
- JSON parsing: Valid JSON.
- MathML: No HTML-escaped math found; `<math>` open/close tags are balanced across the file.
- SVG: All embedded SVG strings are well-formed XML and include `viewBox` where used.

## Corrections Applied
- Updated Question 18 explanation to remove invalid `<mangle>` tags and use standard MathML tokens.

# SAT Math Question Difficulty Audit

Source JSON: `e:\TraeRepo\SAT-AI\QuestionBank\Math\Create\20260113\Geometry and Trigonometry\Lines, angles, and triangles\20260113_12_gpt_v5.2.json`

## 1. Difficulty Distribution Summary
- Declared Distribution: Easy 4, Medium 6, Hard 10
- Audited Distribution: Easy 12, Medium 8, Hard 0
- Alignment Score: 35% (7/20 correctly labeled)

## 2. Mislabeled Questions Log
| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Medium | Easy | Single parallel-lines fact (corresponding angles are equal) with no additional reasoning. |
| 8 | Medium | Easy | One linear equation from supplementary angles; routine algebra. |
| 9 | Medium | Easy | Direct recall of perpendicular slopes as negative reciprocals. |
| 11 | Hard | Medium | Requires converting an obtuse transversal angle to its supplement, then triangle angle sum; multi-step but straightforward. |
| 12 | Hard | Easy | Just doubles the bisected angle and uses triangle angle sum; no hidden insight. |
| 13 | Hard | Medium | Standard triangle angle-sum equation with like-term combining; moderate algebra, not high-insight. |
| 14 | Hard | Medium | Uses isosceles base angles, triangle sum, then angle-bisector partition; clear procedural path. |
| 15 | Hard | Medium | Routine setup using right angle plus triangle sum to solve a linear equation. |
| 16 | Hard | Easy | One-step alternate interior angles property. |
| 17 | Hard | Easy | One-step vertical angles equation; routine solving. |
| 18 | Hard | Easy | Adds two given parts of an angle, then uses triangle sum; entirely direct. |
| 19 | Hard | Medium | Uses a corresponding angle from a parallel line, then takes the exterior supplement; two-step but not complex. |
| 20 | Hard | Easy | Two congruent angles plus triangle sum; one variable, direct solve. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis (Optional)
- Borderline Medium/Easy: Q6 (exterior angle theorem) can be Easy for well-prepared students, but Medium is defensible.
- Well-calibrated Medium: Q7 and Q10 both require organizing multiple pieces into a clean equation/angle chase without hidden tricks.
