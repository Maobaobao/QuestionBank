## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metadata | Metadata Consistency | All checks pass: domains/skills match, total_questions=20, difficulty_distribution (easy:4, medium:6, hard:10) matches tally, question_type_distribution (MCQ:15, SPR:5) matches. No issues. | No correction needed. |
| 4 | Mathematical Error | The data set {4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12} is bimodal (4 and 7 both appear twice), but answer "A" claims mode is 4. Explanation contains forbidden scratchpad reasoning and suggests adjustments. | Change data in question to "4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12" to make mode uniquely 4. Clean explanation to: "Choice A is correct. The mode is the data value that appears most frequently. In this data set, 4 appears twice, and all other values appear once.<br><br>Choice B is incorrect. This value appears once.<br>Choice C is incorrect. This value appears once.<br>Choice D is incorrect. This value appears once." |
| 5 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation for choice D is vague ("This is the mode or something."). | Change to: "Choice D is incorrect. This is one of the data values, but not the median." |
| 6 | Mathematical Error | With given frequencies, mean=80 which equals median=80, so mode < median < mean is false (equals, not less). Explanation has scratchpad and adjusts frequencies. | Change table frequencies to 70:4, 75:3, 80:2, 85:2, 90:1, 95:1, 100:2. Update question text with new table. Clean explanation to: "Choice A is correct. The mode is 70, as it has the highest frequency of 4. To find the median, the ordered list has four 70s, three 75s, two 80s, two 85s, one 90, one 95, and two 100s. With 15 values, the median is the 8th value, which is 80. The mean is <math display='inline'><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>70</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>75</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>80</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>85</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>90</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>95</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>100</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>/</mo><mn>15</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>1220</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>15</mn><mo>≈</mo><mn>81.33</mn></mrow></math>. Thus, 70 < 80 < 81.33.<br><br>Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from miscalculating the mean, median, or mode." |
| 8 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation contains scratchpad ("but if the number of values is odd to even or position, but assume it doesn't affect median position."). Question is ambiguous; median may change depending on n and data ordering. | Clean explanation to: "Choice A is correct. Adding a value greater than the mean increases the mean. The median stays the same if the new value is greater than all existing values and does not affect the middle position(s).<br><br>Choice B is incorrect. The mean increases.<br>Choice C is incorrect. The median may stay the same.<br>Choice D is incorrect. The mean increases." |
| 9 | Difficulty Mismatch | Question involves simple one-step calculation (max = min + range), fitting Easy per guidelines, but labeled Medium. | Change difficulty to "Easy". Note: This changes distribution to easy:5, medium:5; no further adjustment proposed as it's minor. |
| 11 | Chart Mismatch | SVG does not represent a standard box plot: rect covers only Q1 to median, missing median to Q3 portion, creating a visual gap. Description is accurate, but SVG mismatches standard format. | Update SVG code: For Group A, change rect width="107" to width="160". For Group B, change rect width="107" to width="133"; change all instances of "227" for vertical and right line start to "173"; change right line x1="227" to x1="253". |
| 12 | Mathematical Error | List misses 36, making sum 450 (mean ≈40.91), not 440 (mean 40) as stated. Answer "68" incorrect; correct max x=64. Explanation has scratchpad, concludes 64 but answer mismatches. | Change list in question to "35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45". Change answer to "64". Clean explanation to: "The correct answer is 64. The sum of the 11 integers is 440. The mean of the 12 values is <math display='inline'><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>440</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>/</mo><mn>12</mn><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></math>, where k is an integer greater than 40 and x < 70, x > 40. To maximize x, set k=42, so x=504-440=64." |
| 13 | Mathematical Error | Y frequencies sum to 19, not 25. Explanation notes mistake, adjusts frequencies, has scratchpad. | Change Y frequencies in table to 10:4, 11:5, 12:6, 13:5, 14:5. Clean explanation to: "Choice A is correct. The sum for data set X is <math display='inline'><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>11</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>12</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>13</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>14</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>310</mn></mrow></math>, mean 310/25=12.4. For Y, sum is <math display='inline'><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>11</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>12</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>13</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>14</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>302</mn></mrow></math>, mean 302/25=12.08. Thus, mean X > mean Y.<br><br>Choices B, C, and D are incorrect based on the calculations." |
| 19 | Mathematical Error | Sum of added values is 91 - 60 = 31, but answer is "32". Explanation has scratchpad, notes 31 but suggests adjust to 32. Range condition mentioned but not used for sum. | Change answer to "31". Clean explanation to: "The correct answer is 31. The original sum is 60. The new sum is 7 × 13 = 91. The sum of the two added values is 91 - 60 = 31." |
| All | MathML Validation | No mathematical expressions in explanations are encapsulated in <math> tags as required. | Add MathML tags to all explanations with expressions or calculations (e.g., Q6, Q12, Q13, Q16, etc.). Examples provided in corrected JSON. |
| All | Typo/Grammar | Minor: Some questions/explanations have unnecessary \n or awkward phrasing, but no major grammar issues. | Clean text for conciseness in corrected JSON (e.g., remove extra \n in questions). |
| All | Content & Typo Audit | SVGs use double quotes (valid, but guidelines prefer single for attributes to minimize escaping). No other major typos. Chart descriptions are descriptive and free of technical notes. | Change SVG attribute quotes to single where possible (e.g., viewBox='0 0 400 300'). |

### 1. Difficulty Distribution Summary
- **Declared Distribution:** Easy: 4, Medium: 6, Hard: 10
- **Audited Distribution:** Easy: 7, Medium: 11, Hard: 2
- **Alignment Score:** 45% (9 out of 20 questions correctly labeled)

### 2. Mislabeled Questions Log

| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Medium | Easy | Finding the median for an even number of values involves direct application of the formula (average of the two middle numbers after ordering), requiring only 1-2 straightforward steps with no conceptual integration or interpretation needed. |
| 7 | Medium | Easy | Identifying the maximum value in a frequency table is a direct lookup for the highest value with non-zero frequency, involving low cognitive load and a single step. |
| 9 | Medium | Easy | Calculating the maximum from range and minimum uses basic arithmetic (max = min + range), a one-step application of a core definition in a familiar context. |
| 11 | Hard | Medium | Interpreting medians from box plots and recognizing that means cannot be determined combines graph reading with basic statistical knowledge, requiring 2-3 steps but no non-obvious insight. |
| 13 | Hard | Medium | Computing means from frequency tables for two datasets involves procedural calculations (sum of value × frequency divided by total), combining 2-3 steps of organization and arithmetic without abstract modeling. |
| 14 | Hard | Medium | Applying properties of data transformations (adding a constant affects mean but not standard deviation) requires moderate recall and understanding of concepts, with 2 steps but no dense logic. |
| 15 | Hard | Medium | Deducting implications of zero standard deviation (all values equal, range zero) involves conceptual reasoning about spread measures, but it is a straightforward integration of related ideas without pitfalls. |
| 16 | Hard | Medium | Backcalculating the removed value using mean and sum involves 2-3 arithmetic steps (total sum, remaining sum, difference), with moderate organization but standard application. |
| 18 | Hard | Medium | Applying the property of multiplication on standard deviation is a direct conceptual recall, similar to other transformations, with low steps and familiar context. |
| 19 | Hard | Medium | Finding the sum of added values from changes in mean uses basic sum calculations (new total - original total), requiring 2 steps despite additional range context (which is not needed for the answer). |
| 20 | Hard | Medium | Comparing standard deviations conceptually (recognizing outlier impact) integrates knowledge of spread but involves moderate evaluation without complex computation or insight. |

### 3. Detailed Analysis (Optional)
- **Borderline Questions:** Q11 is close to Hard due to the subtle insight that means are not determinable from box plots, which could trip up students unfamiliar with the limitations of the display; however, it aligns more with Medium as it primarily tests interpretation rather than novel problem-solving. Q15 and Q20 are well-calibrated conceptually but lean Medium as they lack the multi-layered distractors typical of Hard questions. Q12 and Q17 are particularly well-calibrated as Hard, requiring modular arithmetic/constraints and case-based positioning, respectively, which demand non-obvious insights.
