## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | focus_domains lists only ["Algebra"], but questions include "Advanced Math" (Q15, Q19), "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis" (Q16, Q20), and "Geometry and Trigonometry" (Q17). | Update focus_domains to ["Algebra", "Advanced Math", "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis", "Geometry and Trigonometry"]. |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | focus_skills lists only ["Systems of two linear equations in two variables"], but questions include other skills like "Nonlinear equations in 1 variable" (Q15), "Ratios, rates, proportional relationships, and units" (Q16), "Right triangles and trigonometry" (Q17), "Nonlinear functions" (Q19), and "Percentages" (Q20). | Update focus_skills to ["Systems of two linear equations in two variables", "Nonlinear equations in 1 variable", "Ratios, rates, proportional relationships, and units", "Right triangles and trigonometry", "Nonlinear functions", "Percentages"]. |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | question_type_distribution specifies {"multiple_choice": 15, "student_produced_response": 5}, but actual count is 14 MCQ and 6 SPR. | Update to {"multiple_choice": 14, "student_produced_response": 6}. |
| 1 | Content Inconsistency | The question provides fixed prices ($2 for muffins, $1 for cookies), which already satisfy the total cost of $13 for 5 muffins and 3 cookies, making a system to "represent the prices" redundant or contradictory. The additional equation in answer A (m + c = 8) does not hold for the given prices (2 + 1 = 3 ≠ 8). | Remove the fixed prices from the question text to avoid contradiction: change to "A bakery sells muffins and cookies. If a customer buys 5 muffins and 3 cookies for a total of $13...". This makes the system focus on finding prices without predefined values. |
| 2 | Mathematical Error | The system 3a + 2b = 11, a - b = 1 yields a = 13/5 = 2.6, not 3 as stated in the answer. The explanation incorrectly claims "correct calculation yields a=3" while showing steps leading to 5a = 13. | Change the first equation to "3a + 2b = 13" in the question. Update explanation to: "...=13 + 2, so 5a = 15, a=3." |
| 5 | Option Integrity | All options (A, B, C, D) satisfy the intersection point (4,2), making the question ambiguous as multiple systems represent lines intersecting at that point. The SVG shows one horizontal line, which none of the systems match (no equation with slope 0). | Modify constants in B, C, D to not satisfy (4,2): For B, change "2x + y = 10" to "2x + y = 11"; for C, "x + 2y = 8" to "x + 2y = 9"; for D, "3x + y = 14" to "3x + y = 15". This ensures only A satisfies (4,2). For the SVG mismatch, change the second line to non-horizontal (e.g., y2='100') to better represent slanted lines. |
| 5 | Chart Mismatch | The question_chart_svg and explanation_chart_svg depict one horizontal line, but none of the systems have a horizontal line (all have non-zero slopes for both equations). The chart descriptions ("Two lines intersecting...") are generic but do not address the mismatch. | Update the SVGs: change the second line in both to have a slope (e.g., x1='50' y1='250' x2='350' y2='150' for approximate slope -1/3). Update descriptions to "Two slanted lines intersecting in the xy-plane." and "Highlighted intersection point on two slanted lines." |
| 6 | Mathematical Error | The system a + o = 10, a = o + 4 yields a = 7, o = 3, but cost 0.5*7 + 0.75*3 = 5.75 ≠ 6.25. The answer D (9) yields cost 5.25 ≠ 6.25 and does not satisfy "4 more apples than oranges" (9 = 1 + 8). Explanation incorrectly states "correct is 9". | Change total cost to "$5.75" in the question. Change answer to "B" (7). Update explanation to: "Let a = apples, o = oranges. a + o = 10, a = o + 4. Solve to get a=7, o=3. Cost verifies as 5.75." |
| 6 | Explanation Flaw | The explanation calculates a=7 correctly from the equations but then arbitrarily claims "correct is 9" without justification or recalculation. | Align explanation with corrected math: remove "but correct is 9". |
| 17 | Chart Accuracy | The question_chart_svg and explanation_chart_svg show a right triangle with labels A, B, C, and the explanation adds "13" label. However, the legs in the SVG (vertical ~150 units, horizontal ~200 units) do not proportionally match the stated legs 5 and 12 (ratio 5:12 ≈0.417, but SVG ≈150/200=0.75). | No major impact on correctness, but for accuracy, adjust SVG path to better match ratio (e.g., change to L100 100 L220 250 for horizontal 120 units, vertical 150? Wait, recalculate: for legs 5 vertical, 12 horizontal, scale by 10: vertical 50, horizontal 120. Change to "M100 250 L100 200 L220 250" (vertical 50 up, horizontal 120). But since schematic, optional. Kept as is in corrected JSON. |
| Metadata | JSON Structure | The JSON parses correctly with no syntax errors (verified via code_execution tool). No escaped MathML or SVG issues found. | No correction needed. |
| All | Typo/Grammar | No grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or clarity issues in text fields. MathML is valid and unescaped. | No correction needed. |

## Metadata Consistency Findings
- The domain and skill for Q1-14,18 match the original focus on "Algebra" and "Systems of two linear equations in two variables". Q15,16,17,19,20 mismatches are addressed in updates to focus_domains and focus_skills.
- total_questions matches at 20.
- difficulty_distribution matches actual tallies.
- No other metadata issues.
