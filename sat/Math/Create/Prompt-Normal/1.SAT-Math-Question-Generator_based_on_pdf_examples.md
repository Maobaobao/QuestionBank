## Quality Requirements and Constraints

### Originality

- Create entirely new scenarios, values, and wording
- DO NOT reuse any numbers, figures, diagrams, or text from example PDFs
- Generate fresh mathematical contexts and real-world applications
- Make sure the domains and skills names only come from the provided list

### Clarity and Rigor

- Questions must be unambiguous and solvable from provided information
- Match official SAT tone, precision, and difficulty level
- Use SAT-consistent mathematical language and notation
- Ensure math notation is clear and consistent in **MathML format**

### Data and Visuals

- If questions require charts/tables/diagrams, describe clearly in text or structured data
- Ensure all visual elements can be understood or rendered from description
- Create SVG charts if needed for the question contexts
- Make sure the content of the SVG chart can be rendered in the web page and displays correctly to match the question contents

### Coverage Requirements

- Ensure focus domains/skills match the examples provided
- Receive heavier representation while maintaining balance to cover other domains/skills
- Maintain ~75% MCQ and ~25% SPR distribution (15 MCQ, 5 SPR)

### Answer Requirements

- **MCQ**: Provide exactly four options (A-D) with one correct answer
- **SPR**: Specify expected numeric format (integer, decimal places, range constraints). `options` field should be `null`.
- Include concise solution explanation for each question
- **Questions with chart or diagram** should include clear explanation with charts or diagrams
- Provide actionable score-improvement tips per question

### Mathematical Notation Fidelity

- **Standard:** All mathematical expressions **MUST** be encapsulated within `<math>` tags, using MathML-like presentation markup for perfect rendering on web platforms.
- **Required Syntax:**
  - Variables: `<mi>x</mi>`
  - Numbers: `<mn>5</mn>`
  - Operators: `<mo>+</mo>`, `<mo>-</mo>`, `<mo>=</mo>`, `<mo>></mo>`
  - Fractions: `<mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac>`
  - Exponents: `<msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>`
  - Square Roots: `<msqrt><mi>x</mi></msqrt>`
  - Parentheses/Brackets: `<mo>(</mo> ... <mo>)</mo>`
- **Example:** The equation \( \frac{x^2 - 1}{3} > 5 \) must be written as:
  `<math><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mo>></mo><mn>5</mn></math>`
- **Validation:** Before finalizing, parse every `<math>` block to ensure it is well-formed and logically represents the intended expression.

### SVG Chart & Diagram Integrity

- **Purpose:** SVGs are not just illustrations; they are integral to the question and must be data-accurate.
- **Technical Specifications:**
  - Include a `viewBox` attribute (e.g., `viewBox='0 0 400 300'`) for scalable rendering.
  - Use absolute coordinates for precise placement of lines, points, and labels.
  - **Coordinate System Note:** (Internal instruction only) Remember that in SVG, the y-axis increases **downward**. (0,0) is top-left. You must flip mathematical y-coordinates (e.g., `svg_y = height - math_y`) to plot graphs correctly.
  - All text (labels, numbers) must be part of the SVG as `<text>` elements.
  - **JSON Safety:** Ensure the SVG string is a valid JSON string (escape double quotes as `\"` and use `<br>` for newlines, or keep it on a single line).
- **Semantic Accuracy:**
  - The visual data (slope of a line, position of a point, shape of a parabola) must match the question's textual information and the correct answer.
  - For graphs of functions, plot key points accurately (e.g., vertex, intercepts).
- **Metadata:** The `question_chart_description` field must succinctly describe the chart for accessibility and verification (e.g., "Scatterplot with a strong positive linear correlation, showing 8 data points."). **Do NOT include technical implementation details like "y-axis increases downward" in this description.**
- **Validation:** Mentally "solve" the question using only the SVG to ensure it contains all necessary information.


## Generation Process

### Step 1: Scan the example questions

- Scan the example questions and understand the structure and format, including question types, domains, skills, difficulty levels, and answer formats.
- Note any common patterns, themes, or inconsistencies in the examples.

### Step 2: Plan Domain/Skill Coverage

- Create a brief outline mapping each of the 20 questions to:
  - Domain & Skill (e.g., "Advanced Math - Nonlinear functions")
  - Difficulty Level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  - Question Type (MCQ or SPR)
  - A one-sentence concept (e.g., "Find the vertex of a parabola from its factored form.").
- Ensure the focus domains/skills from the examples are well-represented.

### Step 3: Allocate Difficulty and Question Types

- Assign questions to Easy, Medium, Hard following difficulty distribution:
  - **Easy:** Routine, one-step problems, or direct application of a single core concept (e.g., substitution, basic properties of shapes). Often relies on familiar setups.
  - **Medium:** Requires combining two distinct concepts, interpreting a slightly complex word problem, or performing multiple procedural steps where the path is generally clear.
  - **Hard:** Requires a non-obvious insight, complex modeling, handling abstract constants/variables, or navigating "distractor-heavy" logic. Simple multi-step calculations (like standard angle chasing) are usually **not** Hard unless they involve obscure theorems.
- Allocate approximately 75% MCQ and 25% SPR across generated questions
- Ensure balanced distribution

### Step 4: Write Questions

- Use SAT-consistent language and style
- For MCQ: provide options A–D with exactly one correct answer
- For SPR: specify expected numeric format and any constraints
- For questions that require charts and diagrams, include charts or diagrams
- Ensure questions test the intended skills and difficulty levels

### Step 5: Provide Explanations and Tips

- **Explanation:** Provide a concise, step-by-step walkthrough of the solution.
- **Explanation Chart (if used):** The `explanation_chart_svg` can be an annotated version of the question chart (e.g., with auxiliary line, highlighted angles, or plotted points).
- **Score Improvement Tip:** Offer specific, actionable pieces of advice related to the tested skill.

### Step 6: Pre-Flight JSON Assembly & Check

- Assemble all components into the JSON structure.
- **Perform a final quality audit:**
  1.  **Math Check:** Is every mathematical expression correctly formatted in `<math>` tags and accurate?
  2.  **SVG Check:** Does the SVG render the intended scenario correctly? Is it scalable (has a `viewBox`)? Is it labeled properly? Is it a valid JSON string?
  3.  **Logic Check:** Is the question solvable? Is the answer correct? Are the distractors logical for MCQs?
  4.  **JSON Check:** Is the output a single, valid JSON object with all required fields populated?

### Step 7: Finalize JSON Output

- Complete all metadata fields accurately
- Include comprehensive scoring guidelines
- Summarize what each difficulty level tests
- Verify all questions, answers, and explanations are complete

## Output Format

Use the JSON template below, populating all fields accurately. **Ensure strings containing SVG code are properly escaped (prefer single line with single quotes for attributes) so the JSON is valid.**

## Important Reminders

- Use example PDFs ONLY for style calibration - do not copy content
- Ensure mathematical notation is clear in **MathML format** and can be rendered in the web page without errors
- Maintain SAT's high standards for question quality and clarity
- Focus on specified domains/skills while ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Verify all JSON fields are complete and accurate before delivery
- Make sure the SVG of question_chart_svg and explanation_chart_svg is valid, renderable in a web page, and displays correctly to precisely match the question or explanation contents (e.g., accurate geometry, labels, and scales)

## Deliverable

A single, valid JSON object that passes the "Pre-Flight Check." The object must be complete, ready for integration into a digital testing platform, and must exemplify the highest standards of SAT question design, particularly in the clarity of its mathematical notation and the accuracy of its visual components.
