## Detailed Issue Log
| Q# | Category | Issue Description | Proposed Correction |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Metadata | Metadata Inconsistency | focus_domains and focus_skills only list "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis" and "Inference from sample statistics and margin of error", but questions include multiple domains (e.g., Algebra, Advanced Math, Geometry and Trigonometry) and skills (e.g., Linear equations, Circles). This is a significant mismatch. | Update focus_domains to ["Algebra", "Advanced Math", "Geometry and Trigonometry", "Problem-Solving and Data Analysis"]. Update focus_skills to ["Inference from sample statistics and margin of error", "Linear equations in 1 variable", "Linear inequalities in 1 or 2 variables", "Systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables", "Equivalent expressions", "Nonlinear equations in 1 variable", "Nonlinear functions", "Probability and conditional probability", "Circles", "Lines, angles, and triangles", "Right triangles and trigonometry"]. |
| 1 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expressions (e.g., 12/40 = 0.3) are not encapsulated in <math> tags. | Rewrite explanation: "The proportion in the sample is <math><mfrac><mn>12</mn><mn>40</mn></mfrac> = 0.3</math>. For 120 students, the estimate is <math>120 \times 0.3 = 36</math>." |
| 2 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expressions (e.g., 15 - 2) are not in <math> tags. | Rewrite: "The margin of error gives a plausible range of <math>15 - 2</math> to <math>15 + 2</math>, or 13 to 17 hours." |
| 3 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expressions (e.g., 20/50 = 0.4) not in <math> tags. | Rewrite: "The sample proportion is <math><mfrac><mn>20</mn><mn>50</mn></mfrac> = 0.4</math>, or 40%." |
| 6 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expressions (e.g., 50 - 4) not in <math> tags. | Rewrite: "The margin applies to the mean, giving a plausible range for the population mean of <math>50 - 4</math> to <math>50 + 4</math> feet." |
| 7 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expression (45% + 5%) not in <math> tags. | Rewrite: "Upper bound is <math>45\% + 5\% = 50\%</math>." |
| 8 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation contains forbidden chain-of-thought/self-correction ("Wait, both positive, but assuming the larger."). Ambiguous question ("positive solution") since both roots are positive. | Rewrite explanation to direct style: "The equation factors as <math><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>. The solutions are 2 and 4." Change question to "What is the larger positive solution...". |
| 9 | JSON Structure | SVG uses double quotes for attributes and is multi-line; preference is single quotes and single line for JSON safety. | Rewrite question_chart_svg and explanation_chart_svg to single line with single quotes (e.g., width='200'). |
| 13 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expressions (e.g., 12 × 600) not in <math> tags. | Rewrite: "40% of 15 is 6 students in the sample. The estimated number per class is <math>0.4 \times 30 = 12</math>. For 600 classes, the total is <math>12 \times 600 = 7200</math>." |
| 14 | Chart Mismatch | Bar heights (100, 80, 120, 60 units) suggest percentages like 50%, 40%, 60%, 30%, but options list 50%, 55%, 65%, 45%. Explanation is vague ("Assuming margins...") and not direct. SVG uses double quotes and multi-line. | Change options to {'A': 'Sample 1 (50%)', 'B': 'Sample 2 (40%)', 'C': 'Sample 3 (60%)', 'D': 'Sample 4 (30%)'}. Rewrite explanation: "The bar heights correspond to estimates of 50%, 40%, 60%, and 30%. The true value of 60% falls within the plausible range for Sample 3, assuming a reasonable margin of error." Rewrite SVG to single line/single quotes. |
| 15 | Mathematical Error | Question has +5, leading to remainder -3, but options and answer assume +3 (for +11). Explanation contains forbidden chain-of-thought ("but wait, correct... Close, so option D if changed... Adjust dividend..."). | Change question constant to +11: "<math><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>6</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>11</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac></math>". Rewrite explanation: "Polynomial division gives quotient <math><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></math> and remainder 3, since <math><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>6</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>8</mn></math> and <math>11 - 8 = 3</math>. Thus, <math><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac></math>." |
| 16 | Difficulty Mismatch | Extracting radius from circle equation is Medium difficulty (direct application of standard form), not Hard. | Change difficulty to "Medium". |
| 17 | Explanation Flaw | Mathematical expression (30/50 = 0.6) not in <math> tags. | Rewrite: "<math>P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{30}{50} = 0.6</math>." |
| 18 | Difficulty Mismatch | Finding vertex x-coordinate using -b/(2a) is Medium (standard formula application), not Hard. | Change difficulty to "Medium". |
| 19 | Difficulty Mismatch | Solving a linear inequality in one variable is Medium (multi-step but routine), not Hard. | Change difficulty to "Medium". |
| 20 | Explanation Flaw | Explanation contains assumptive language ("but assume isosceles..."), not direct. SVG uses double quotes and multi-line. | Rewrite: "The triangle is isosceles with equal side lengths, so the base angles are both 68°. The vertex angle x is <math>180^{\circ} - 2 \times 68^{\circ} = 44^{\circ}</math>." Rewrite SVG to single line/single quotes. |
## Metadata Consistency Findings
- total_questions, difficulty_distribution, and question_type_distribution match the questions array exactly (Easy:4, Medium:6, Hard:10; MCQ:15, SPR:5).
- After proposed difficulty changes (Q16,18,19 to Medium), update difficulty_distribution to {"easy": 4, "medium": 9, "hard": 7}.
- No issues found in JSON syntactic structure (parsed successfully via code_execution).
- No issues found in text quality (grammar/spelling) or MathML validity beyond noted flaws.
- Chart descriptions are purely descriptive with no technical notes.

### 1. Difficulty Distribution Summary
- **Declared Distribution:** Easy: 4, Medium: 9, Hard: 7
- **Audited Distribution:** Easy: 10, Medium: 7, Hard: 3
- **Alignment Score:** 50% (10 out of 20 questions correctly labeled)

### 2. Mislabeled Questions Log
| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7 | Medium | Easy | Calculating the upper bound is a direct 1-step addition (45% + 5%); no combination of concepts or interpretation needed beyond basic arithmetic. |
| 8 | Medium | Easy | Factoring a simple quadratic (x² - 6x + 8) requires straightforward recall of factoring technique; 1-2 steps with familiar setup. |
| 9 | Medium | Easy | Applying the Pythagorean theorem to a 5-12-? right triangle is direct recall; recognizes common triple (13) with minimal steps. |
| 11 | Hard | Medium | Identifying that 45% is outside the 36%-44% range requires moderate interpretation of the margin concept but only 2 steps without non-obvious insight. |
| 13 | Hard | Medium | Extrapolating the proportion (0.4 × 30 × 600) involves 2-3 organized steps and basic scaling, but no abstract modeling or pitfalls. |
| 16 | Medium | Easy | Extracting the radius as √16 = 4 is direct application of the circle equation standard form; 1 step with no complexity. |
| 17 | Hard | Medium | Applying the conditional probability formula P(A|B) = 30/50 involves plugging in given numbers; moderate as it combines overlap concept but straightforward. |
| 18 | Medium | Easy | Using the vertex formula x = -b/(2a) = 4/2 = 2 is direct recall; 1 step with standard quadratic form. |
| 19 | Medium | Easy | Solving the inequality (subtract terms, isolate x) requires 2 straightforward steps; familiar linear process with no flip needed here. |
| 20 | Hard | Medium | Recognizing the isosceles triangle from the diagram and calculating 180° - 2×68° combines geometry concepts (angle sum + properties) in 2-3 steps, but not abstract or insight-heavy. |

### 3. Detailed Analysis (Optional)
- **Borderline Questions:** Q5 (assigned Medium) is well-calibrated as medium; it tests nuanced understanding of sampling (approximate vs. exact), which adds moderate cognitive load beyond simple calculation. Q12 (assigned Hard) is appropriately hard, as inferring the sample size-margin relationship requires non-obvious insight into statistical principles not always directly taught. Q14 (assigned Hard) is borderline hard due to the need to assume unspecified margins while interpreting the chart, potentially introducing distractors.
- **Well-Calibrated Examples:** Q1-Q4 and Q10 are spot-on as easy/medium, matching routine applications. Q15 is excellently hard, demanding polynomial division insight and remainder handling in an abstract algebraic context.
