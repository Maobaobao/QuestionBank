# Math Test JSON Verification Report

## Summary
- Total Questions: 20
- Issues Found: 0
- Critical Errors: 0
- Minor Issues/Warnings: 0

## Detailed Issue Log
No issues found.

## Metadata Consistency Findings
- `total_questions` matches the `questions` array length (20).
- Difficulty distribution matches exactly (Easy: 4, Medium: 6, Hard: 10).
- Question type distribution matches exactly (MCQ: 15, SPR: 5).
- `focus_domains` matches all question `domain` values (Problem-Solving and Data Analysis).
- `focus_skills` matches all question `skill` values (Inference from sample statistics and margin of error).
- Question numbering is complete and unique (1 through 20).

## Mathematical Correctness & Internal Consistency Findings
- Answer verification: No answer/explanation mismatches detected during review.
- Explanation style: Explanations are instructional; no “scratchpad” phrasing detected (e.g., “Let me…”, “Wait…”).
- MCQ option integrity: All MCQs have exactly A–D options; no duplicate option texts detected; correct answer keys are valid.
- SPR integrity: No empty student-produced responses detected.

## Content & Format Audit Findings
- JSON syntax: Valid JSON (parses successfully).
- MathML: No digits or percent signs appear outside `<math>...</math>` in `question`, `explanation`, or `score_improvement_tip`.
- MathML: No HTML-escaped MathML detected (no `&lt;math` occurrences).
- SVG: No HTML-escaped SVG detected; any SVG fields (when present) appear to be raw `<svg...>` strings.
- Chart descriptions: No technical implementation notes detected in chart descriptions (when present).

## Part 2: Corrected JSON File
No issues found. The original JSON is accurate and requires no corrections.

# Difficulty Audit Report

## Difficulty Distribution Summary
- Declared Distribution: Easy 4, Medium 6, Hard 10
- Audited Distribution: Easy 12, Medium 7, Hard 1
- Alignment Score: 35% (7/20 correctly labeled)

## Mislabeled Questions Log
| Q# | Assigned Difficulty | Assessed Difficulty | Reason for Reclassification |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Medium | Easy | Only applies margin of error to form the interval; 1 step. |
| 6 | Medium | Easy | Single concept: larger random sample → smaller margin of error. |
| 7 | Medium | Easy | Basic interpretation of “likely” interval vs certainty; 1 concept. |
| 8 | Medium | Easy | Computes a simple proportion and converts to percent. |
| 11 | Hard | Medium | Compute plausible intervals and note overlap; straightforward multi-step. |
| 12 | Hard | Medium | Compute sample proportion, convert to percent, subtract margin of error. |
| 13 | Hard | Easy | Single concept: increasing sample size reduces margin of error. |
| 14 | Hard | Medium | Requires distinguishing plausible interval from a guarantee; moderate conceptual nuance. |
| 15 | Hard | Easy | Straight sampling-method identification: simple random sample is most representative. |
| 16 | Hard | Medium | Compute sample percent and add margin of error for an upper bound. |
| 17 | Hard | Easy | Single concept: larger random sample → smaller margin of error. |
| 18 | Hard | Medium | Build margin-of-error interval and compare to 75% claim; moderate reasoning. |
| 19 | Hard | Easy | Direct interpretation of margin of error as a likely population interval. |

## Detailed Analysis (Optional)
- Q20 (Hard) is well-calibrated: it requires the non-obvious relationship that margin of error scales like <math><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mi>n</mi></msqrt></math>, so doubling <math><mi>n</mi></math> reduces the margin of error by about <math><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></math>.
